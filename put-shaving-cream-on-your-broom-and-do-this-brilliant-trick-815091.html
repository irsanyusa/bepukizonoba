There’s a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;scrub and it&nbsp;gets really uncomfortable. But here’s a&nbsp;great trick that will save you a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time&nbsp;— and money. This magic product may be&nbsp;hidden in&nbsp;your bathroom cabinet, too! All you need is&nbsp;some shaving cream and a&nbsp;broom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5b3/e87/496b77572b823c38e1b0ff075e.png><p>The shaving cream will help with cleaning up&nbsp;your bathtub, and by&nbsp;using the broom, you’ll spare yourself unnecessary back pain. Once you’re happy with the results, just rinse it&nbsp;off. That can of&nbsp;shaving cream can be&nbsp;used for a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other things around the house. You can cover the bristles of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=toilet data-link=tag>toilet</a> brush with&nbsp;it, for an&nbsp;overnight disinfecting routine. Not to&nbsp;mention you can then clean the toilet with it&nbsp;and have it&nbsp;smell quite nice.</p><p>Has your kitchen sink ever gotten clogged? I&nbsp;mean we&nbsp;all had such a&nbsp;problem at&nbsp;least once, but here’s a&nbsp;nice idea that will spare you a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;the store for those harsh unclogging solutions. Mix some leftover coffee grounds with dish soap. Pour them down your drain and let them do&nbsp;their magic for a&nbsp;short while. Then just pour a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;hot water. This combination should break up&nbsp;whatever food residue got stuck in&nbsp;your pipes. Not to&nbsp;mention it&nbsp;also helps with the bad smell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cd3/891/ae5774521bb097f802036edbff.png><p>You may already be&nbsp;using lemon essential oil around your house for its fresh fragrance. But here’s another thing you can use it&nbsp;for: cleaning and polishing dark wood with spots and stains! Tea tree oil works the same way too. To&nbsp;make sure your <a href=# title=furniture data-link=tag>furniture</a> isn’t too delicate, do&nbsp;a&nbsp;little cleaning test on&nbsp;an&nbsp;area that isn’t visible. Apart from taking care of&nbsp;the spots, these oils are also great bug deterrents and they make your furniture smell nice too.</p><p>If&nbsp;you have pets or&nbsp;little ones, you know how hard it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep the living room couch clean. You might not have to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;new one when it&nbsp;gets too much. Try cleaning some of&nbsp;the spots on&nbsp;both the <a href=# title=fabric data-link=tag>fabric</a> and the wood with some toothpaste. It’s good for cleaning and for polishing too. Once you’re done, wipe everything off with a&nbsp;damp towel and let it&nbsp;air dry. The trick here is&nbsp;to&nbsp;not use a&nbsp;whole lot of&nbsp;toothpaste. A&nbsp;pea-sized amount should do&nbsp;the trick, even for the nastiest stains. And it’ll help prevent cavities, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ba6/2a0/db13ad5308a74211244c6b744c.png><p>Scented candles are a&nbsp;great way to&nbsp;spice up&nbsp;your living room décor. But once you spill one of&nbsp;those over, that hot wax can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;nightmare to&nbsp;get rid&nbsp;of. It’s sticky and it&nbsp;can really stain valuable pieces of&nbsp;furniture. More&nbsp;so, if&nbsp;you try to&nbsp;scrape it&nbsp;off, you might end up&nbsp;damaging pieces of&nbsp;wood even more. If&nbsp;you ever spill some wax, here’s what you can try: first, fill a&nbsp;plastic bag with some ice cubes. Then, gently place them over the wax, and let it&nbsp;work its magic. The ice cubes should help cool the wax until it’s solid. You can then simply pick it&nbsp;up&nbsp;without damaging your furniture, <a href=# title=carpet data-link=tag>carpet</a>, or&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;fabric.</p><p>Re-using jars around the kitchen can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice way to&nbsp;repurpose some objects, but we&nbsp;all know how annoying it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;peel those sticky labels off seamlessly. Don’t throw the jar away just yet. Go&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;some cooking oil and a&nbsp;cotton pad. Let the oil sink in&nbsp;on&nbsp;the sticky area then gently rub it&nbsp;off with the pad. The oils should help with breaking down the residue, while the cotton pad is&nbsp;delicate enough to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;it, without scratching the glass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/851/b8f/385a935560bc22d8ab9806199e.png><p><a href=# title=Microwave data-link=tag>Microwave</a> tends to&nbsp;get stinky at&nbsp;times? It’s always a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice scrub every now and then. But if&nbsp;it&nbsp;still has a&nbsp;funky smell even after you’ve cleaned it&nbsp;thoroughly, here’s how you can get rid of&nbsp;the odor: place a&nbsp;bowl of&nbsp;vinegar inside and turn the microwave on&nbsp;for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;minutes. Here’s a&nbsp;simple way you can clean your kettle with vinegar too, without having to&nbsp;risk damaging its electrical parts. Instead of&nbsp;placing plain water in&nbsp;it, fill it&nbsp;up&nbsp;with water and vinegar solution, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;1:1&nbsp;proportion. Then turn it&nbsp;on. The vinegar helps not only with the moldy smell, but it&nbsp;can also helps remove water stains and chalky residues.</p><p>Dusting the blinds is&nbsp;kinda tedious and way too time-consuming. Hey, I&nbsp;might have a&nbsp;solution for it&nbsp;that can save you a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time. Just use a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;kitchen tongs. Rap each end with a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;dish towels, preferably a&nbsp;little damp. That little amount of&nbsp;water will ensure the dust doesn’t go&nbsp;back into the air once you’re done. Secure the tongs with a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;rubber bands and you’ve got yourself a&nbsp;custom blinds duster. Just place each line from the blinds between the tongs and slide as&nbsp;you&nbsp;go. Easy, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/19d/f5f/a1c9f35dc5a8389ae92ff39cd1.png><p>Cleaning up&nbsp;your <a href=# title=blender data-link=tag>blender</a> is&nbsp;not only tiresome, but it&nbsp;can get dangerous at&nbsp;times if&nbsp;you don’t pay enough attention to&nbsp;those sharp blades. Here’s how you can avoid&nbsp;it. Add some dish soap and warm water into the device, and blend away until it’s clean. If&nbsp;you have some stains that are harder to&nbsp;get rid&nbsp;of, don’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;add some baking powder too.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re the kind of&nbsp;person that always has to&nbsp;clean the garbage can after taking out the trash, you might want to&nbsp;try this trick. Place some pieces of&nbsp;old newspaper on&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the can. Even if&nbsp;you throw away something liquid, it&nbsp;should absorb it&nbsp;and you won’t have to&nbsp;give the can a&nbsp;scrub each time you fill up&nbsp;the trash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b04/886/04aa8357a3b23dac6ca5dd3195.png><p>Cats are cute and all, but they are notorious for clawing things around the house. Yeah, nice kitty. Not. I&nbsp;may not have a&nbsp;solution for your drapes just yet, but here’s what you can do&nbsp;for your couch. Try to&nbsp;observe your cat for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days and figure out if&nbsp;it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;favorite spot on&nbsp;the couch where it&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;sharpen its nails. Once you find out what that&nbsp;is, place a&nbsp;small patch of&nbsp;aluminum foil on&nbsp;top. Also, try to&nbsp;secure the foil as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;you can. Your cat might try to&nbsp;dig&nbsp;in, but once it&nbsp;touches the aluminum foil, it&nbsp;will soon figure out it’s too uncomfortable. It&nbsp;might even keep it&nbsp;away from the couch altogether if&nbsp;you’re lucky.</p><p>Never know which key is&nbsp;used for what? We&nbsp;all run around with house, office and mail keys all kept together within the same keychain. If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;hard time differentiating between them, try painting them over! You can use nail polish, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;should last pretty long and it&nbsp;dries up&nbsp;pretty quickly. You might still have to&nbsp;remember which color is&nbsp;which though, just saying...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aba/7d2/9967c854fba3f04e95fb28fdd3.png><p>Some types of&nbsp;clothes&nbsp;— like those made out of&nbsp;silk&nbsp;— really require anti-slip hangers if&nbsp;you don’t want them constantly falling off in&nbsp;your closet. Fortunately, you don’t have to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;fortune on&nbsp;buying new fancy hangers. Just get some pieces of&nbsp;pipe cleaner and wrap them around standard, wire hangers. The pipe cleaner will give the hangers that added grip they need to&nbsp;make sure loose clothes don’t fall off and get all wrinkled.</p><p>If&nbsp;you find your vacuum cleaner isn’t long enough for you to&nbsp;reach all the spaces you need to&nbsp;clean, you might have a&nbsp;simple DIY extension hidden in&nbsp;your office. Once you’ve finished a&nbsp;roll of&nbsp;wrapping paper, save that leftover tube for this precise reason. You can secure it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;your vacuum cleaner pipe and get those extra inches you need to&nbsp;make sure you get rid of&nbsp;dust and cobwebs on&nbsp;the ceiling. Organizing cables has never been this easy&nbsp;— and budget-friendly! Find a&nbsp;shoebox and fill it&nbsp;with toilet paper rolls, sitting vertically. You can then roll up&nbsp;the cables and place them in&nbsp;each tube. Plus, you can even label each tube to&nbsp;easily locate the desired cable next time you’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rush to&nbsp;charge your phone.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL22wIysn5qumaO0bq%2FRnpimZZ%2Bjerq71Ktkm6qfpLpurc2dZJ2nXam1qr%2BMm6mipJyerq%2FAjK2popubYoVygY9yaGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
