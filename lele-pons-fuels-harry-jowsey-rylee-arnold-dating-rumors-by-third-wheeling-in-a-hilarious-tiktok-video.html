Harry remains coy about their status, emphasizing that they simply enjoy each other‚Äôs company and share a deep affection. Meanwhile, Rylee expressed gratitude for the support they‚Äôve received during her debut season as a professional dancer on the ballroom show.</p><p>Following their somewhat tepid <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> premiere, Harry and Rylee made a comeback during Latin Night with a sizzling salsa performance. They danced to ‚ÄúArranca‚Äù by Becky G. featuring Omega, earning a respectable score of 15 out of 30. Fans spotted the pair holding hands in the crowd at a Tate McRae concert in Los Angeles on October 4, further intensifying romance rumors and celebrating their progress.</p><p>While Harry, a familiar face from reality TV, continues to captivate audiences, Rylee is stepping into the spotlight for the first time as a DWTS pro. She follows in the footsteps of her older sister, Lindsay Arnold, who recently decided to step back from the competition series to spend more time with her growing family. Harry, however, makes it clear that his focus is firmly on his partnership with Rylee as they navigate their journey on DWTS.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_JohnLegend_TheVoiceSeason24_Tyler-Golden_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô Recap: Team Legend Earns 2 More Four-Chair Turn Singers ‚Äî&nbsp;Will Team Legend Win Season 24?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y56jnmWgpLu0ecWunKWrXZ2us77YZqGor6Oaxm6%2B2KWcnmWRp7uwuMNmm5qsmaO0br7Upqarq12Xxm7Ax6KpnWWnnbKmuMinnmahnmKubrTIpZiroZ%2BqwG7AyKSrqKNdq7alsc5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
