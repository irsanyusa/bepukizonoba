The main idea behind these next-generation residences is that student housing should not be just a temporary accommodation, but a full-fledged living that offers <strong>everything you need</strong> under one roof. This living concept has become very liked abroad, and it is more and more popular in Prague as well.</p><p>THE FIZZ Prague has been operating since 2020. It is a modern urban residence with a unique architectural design in Holešovice and offers its residents everything they can think of. And even though it is not the most affordable student accommodation in Prague, we definitely have to recommend it. Here are six reasons to spend your student years at THE FIZZ Prague:</p><h2><b>Everything you need is under one roof</b></h2><p>Proper housing for the new generation isn’t just about having a place to lay your head for the night. At THE FIZZ you’ll have not only your apartment with all the facilities including a private kitchenette and bathroom, but you will also have access to a laundry room, a game area with billiard and game consoles, community kitchens, roof terraces, Sky Lounge, a beautiful garden, study rooms, Movie Lounge or Music room. In addition, you can borrow lots of other equipment at the reception from board games and a vacuum cleaner to weights for working out.</p><p><img alt="The FIZZ" decoding=async height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2022/02/b.png width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>&nbsp;<b>You are part of the community</b></h2><p>Sure, you can hole up in your apartment and study if you want, but the last two years have taught us that having a community around you is important for more than just your mental health. At THE FIZZ, you’ll make friends in the hallways or in the community areas, but you might also meet friends at one of the many regular events organized for THE FIZZ residents by House Management team. They not only keep the building running smoothly, but they are the people you can turn to with any problem.</p><h2><b>Everything is at your fingertips</b></h2><p>Who wants to commute tens of minutes by bus when you can live close to the subway station Nádraží Holešovice? A few stops and you’re in the city center or at the university. This is especially handy if you hate waking up early or getting a taxi bill in the middle of the night.</p><h2><b>You’ll make friends from all over the world</b></h2><p>A large number of the students who live at THE FIZZ Prague have come to Prague to study from abroad. You can practice your languages, get to know many cultures, but most importantly, you can make friends for life who you can visit or go on Erasmus with.</p><p><img alt="The FIZZ" decoding=async height=800 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2022/02/c.png width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><b>No more moving around blindly</b></h2><p>With traditional dorms, you never know what you’re getting into. Will you get a room for two or three? Who will be your roommates? Where exactly will you be living in Prague?&nbsp; In addition to open doors events, when you can come and see everything for yourself, THE FIZZ also offers <a href=#>regular viewings</a> of the apartments and the entire residence. In addition, you can choose whether you want to live alone, with your friend or a loved one.</p><h2><b>A proven concept that works</b></h2><p>With more than 10 years of experience and winning several awards, THE FIZZ has established itself as a successful student housing brand throughout Europe. From Berlin, Utrecht to Vienna to smaller cities like Darmstadt and Aachen, THE FIZZ has applied its years of experience and expertise to the design of the Prague building and its operation. So, you can be sure that you will really find everything here to make your student years totally unforgettable.</p><p><img alt="The FIZZ" decoding=async height=933 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.vysokeskoly.cz/czech-universities/uploads/2022/02/d.png width=800 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>To find out more about life at THE FIZZ, visit their <a href=#>website</a> or follow them on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8uLTArWSaqpViwamxjKWYrZ2jqXq1vsSnm6xlmaN6tMDUnZynrF2dvLa%2FyKeeZpuforq2usitsGaho2LBqbGMpJyy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
