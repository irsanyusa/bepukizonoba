(Well, most of the judges.) Their name was In The Stairwell, and what made them special is that their members were all from the United States Air Force Academy.</strong></p><p>The group, which has been around since 2004, was restricted to singing in stairwells, which is how they got their name. Check out their AGT audition in the video below, and read on to find out what the judges thought.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBHwJv07RBk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-air-force-a-cappella-group-sings-on-agt>Air Force A Cappella Group Sings On ‘AGT’</h2><p>When Simon Cowell asked the group if they practiced in the stairwell because they weren’t good, one of the members responded, “It’s ’cause we’re too good, I think.” He added that “so many hours” were put into rehearsing for their audition.</p><p>The group went on to perform an a cappella rendition of “Drag Me Down” by One Direction. They showed off some great harmonies and choreography that had the audience cheering.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>WAR VETERAN WITH PTSD BREAKS DOWN ON ‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’ [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>Three of the AGT judges seemed to be enjoying the performance, but Howie Mandel hit his red buzzer toward the end. His fellow judges were shocked by the move. Simon and Heidi Klum both stood up at the end of the performance.</p><p>Howie thanked the group for their service, but said it “bored” him. The AGT crowd booed him, and Simon said they weren’t booing him loud enough.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PFl_Tuh0LA</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-far-did-in-the-stairwell-go-in-the-competition>How Far Did In The Stairwell Go In The Competition?</h3><p>Mel B said she wasn’t bored, telling the group they “made it feel so full, and fresh, and new.” Heidi said she loves a man in uniform, adding that she thought the group was “very talented.”</p><p>Simon said he thought the choreography was “too much,” but added, “I think people are really, really gonna like you.
