Typically, after the dust settles from the Final Rose ceremony and the "After The Final Rose" special, the newly engaged couple (or still single star living his or her best life) are everywhere.</p><p>They typically start with a late-night TV appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, grace People magazine's cover and, of course, swing by Good Morning America the next day. That makes the total lack of appearances by Peter and/or Madi now that they're a public couple a bit, well, odd.</p><p>After her dramatic season and kicking Jed to the curb on "After The Final Rose," <a href=# id=ddf32747-0eb8-3857-a550-109434735860>Hannah Brown still went on GMA</a> the next morning and discussed how her journey made her stronger with Michael Strahan.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Compare that to this morning's GMA segment that only featured an interview with <a href=# id=4f4e82bd-f1bf-366f-a5ef-335985fe7b7d>host Chris Harrison</a> , in which he discussed trying to referee the drama between Madi and Barb last night.</p><p>Besides a typical People cover story, the post-show coverage also usually includes saying hi to Jimmy Kimmel for his "After the After the After the Final Rose" segment. Check out Jimmy and Hannah B talking after the end of her season:</p><p>And peep this past Tuesday night's segment of Jimmy riffing on clips from the finale:</p><p>Now, not trying to dust up any Bachelor rumors here, but it looks like Peter was unavailable for the usual round of post-finale press! Considering all that went down Tuesday night, if Peter and Madi are looking to spend some one-on-one time out of the media spotlight, that would be 100-percent understandable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOm5icoJWhvLN5z56rnqpdrLKjsdFmmKecXaKupbXSqKVmqKKaxKbA02afmq6Vo8FusM6nnGaZnq56sbvSrWSfoZ6WuaZ5z6ucrKtfbL23t9FpbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
