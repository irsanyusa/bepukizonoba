I had one of the worst years of my life last year because I did not say no. I did not say no to opportunities that I should have said no to. I didn't say no to a fianc√© I should have said no to," she said.</p><p>Using herself as an example, she also encouraged the women present to take things slowly to prevent burnout.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I didn't say no to taking things on. I was on the BBC, then I was on the Morning Breakfast Show, then I was DJing, then I was planning a wedding. Then I was at Oxford University and I burnt myself out. None of us are any good to ourselves or other people when we're burnt out. So we have to deal with that guilt that comes with saying no. It's okay to say no," Cuppy said.</p><p>Back in December 2022, the disk jockey took the internet by storm when she <a href=# id=f9388837-b665-435a-adc2-fca834a94da5 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>announced her engagement</a> to British boxer Ryan Taylor, whom she had met only 25 days prior.

However, she seemed unfazed by the rumours and stated that she didn't want a "perfect love story" because it was "cliche."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In July 2023, the pair unfollowed each other on social media, after which Cuppy confirmed that she was single.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGadol2YwrG82GaqmrGjYsCpsYywmKeslZl6tbuMq5yjnZOperPFwKdkrZmpobyzv4ymmKuqmZa0pnnPq6app6OWuXDEkLNwpp6n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
