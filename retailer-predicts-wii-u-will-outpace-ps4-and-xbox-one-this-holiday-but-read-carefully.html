Rakutin reportedly went on to cite a Twitter analysis, in which it says the Wii U and iPad were “the most talked about presents for children this Christmas.”</p><p>Children are an important demographic — one Nintendo’s appealed to for decades. You could argue, with actual numbers buttressing your argument, that Nintendo’s been&nbsp;the dominant games seller to children since pretty much the original Nintendo Entertainment System. But what are you arguing? Certainly not dominance.</p><p>The Wii U has sold somewhere in the vicinity of four million units worldwide to date, which would be a terrific figure had the console just launched alongside the PS4 and Xbox One last month instead of over a year ago.&nbsp;<span>System sales have been up since Nintendo dropped the price on the Deluxe model $50, further bolstered by the release of Super Mario 3D World&nbsp;before Thanksgiving. But expecting the Wii U to outpace Sony and Microsoft’s multimillions-selling new consoles seems fanciful at best. Marry Wii U sales totals to the 3DS and now you have a plausible overall-brand argument, but unless Sony and Microsoft run into stocking issues, the Wii U by itself is probably a lock for third place.</span></p><p><span>Nothing wrong with third place: Sony’s PlayStation 3 held the position for most of its existence. And there’s no reason, at least not yet, to base your purchase decision on sales projections. This is a long game and we’re still in its early days. The question ought to be “What do you want to play?” All I can tell you is that for me, this holiday, on a set-top console specifically,&nbsp;<a href=#>the answer is simple</a>: Super Mario 3D World&nbsp;and Pikmin 3 and&nbsp;Zelda: The Wind Waker HD.</span></p><p>(<strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;Watch here to some of the games currently available on the Wii U)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmislZi1ra3NnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWljZH5ze49vZqudpJa2rbHRZqernZSesLW%2FjLCgomWlYsSquMtmpq6soJawpnnPrGtmmZ6ZermuzrFkqKaVYsGptdJmn6ikmZmuunnBrqtmqpWWsW6vwKucn62cocZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
