He was known for impressing the judges with his dreamy vocals, but ended up <a href=#>dropping out of the competition</a></strong> <strong>unexpectedly. Fans were sad to see this singer drop out of the competition and rumors as to what made Benson leave the show ran wild, but it’s been revealed that he was <a href=#>given better opportunities</a>.</strong></p><p>This singer went into the American Idol auditions with “<a href=#>Punchline</a>” by Aidan Martin. Within his audition, he admitted that he was a popular singer on TikTok. After performing for the judges, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a> revealed that she could see this singer winning the series. Benson made such an impression on the show that he was given opportunities during the series itself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-benson-boone-is-currently-thriving-in-the-music-scene>Benson Boone is Currently Thriving in The Music Scene</h2><p>Benson recently performed on <a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> and revealed that, although he did make it to the Top 24 of the competition, he withdrew to make his own path in the music industry. Since leaving the show, he has thrived in the music industry on his own. Not only has he remained popular on TikTok, he has recently signed to <a href=#>Night Street/Warner Records.</a></p><p>Almost a year after auditioning for the series, this singer has released a single “Ghost Town” with <a href=#>Night Street/Warner Records</a>. This song became a huge hit, especially on TikTok where it went viral and raised the numbers of Benson’s monthly listeners on Spotify. With two versions of this song released, Benson clocks in almost 9 million monthly listeners on the platform. The single has also peaked on the U.S. Songs iTunes chart at No. 77.</p><p>I’m sure you noticed that Benson’s performance on The Kelly Clarkson Show was unlike the majority of the performances on this talk show. The singer was not in person given the fact that he is currently on an <a href=#>European tour</a>. Benson has made sure to keep fans up to date amid the tour on his Instagram. So far, this singer has traveled to <a href=#>Belgium</a>, <a href=#>Paris</a>, <a href=#>Denmark</a>, <a href=# class=broken_link>Finland</a>, and <a href=# class=broken_link>Sweden</a>.</p><p>Although many fans were sad to see Benson out of the running on American Idol, I’m sure we can all agree that he is quickly on the rise to fame with Warner Records. The success of his debut single is very telling for this young singer. Even though he hasn’t put out much music with his new label he’s still creating a name for himself in the music industry.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1357174737.jpg alt="John Legend Gifts Us with a Music Video for His New Holiday Song" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>benson boone</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6lrKeeYq%2Bwu82eZKKrXam1s7XVoqWgZaOeu6SxjJqknqqZmK6vecidpqVlp57BqbDRmq6apF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
