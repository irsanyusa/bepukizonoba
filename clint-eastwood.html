Thalberg award. Not too shabby for someone who started off in the mid-fifties as a contract player, first cutting his teeth in TV (notably “Rawhide”) before transitioning to movies – and the first of many iconic roles – in Sergio Leone’s “A Fistful of Dollars.”</p><p>As an actor, Eastwood remains one of Hollywood’s last great male icons and last links to the old studio system.
