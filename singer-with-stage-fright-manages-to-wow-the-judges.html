When she steps onto the stage, she is really quiet and nervous</strong>. <strong>This automatically makes the judges skeptical of her, but she quickly proves them wrong!</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shy-singer-makes-the-judges-emotional>Shy Singer Makes the Judges Emotional</h2><p>Alice Fredenham is a 28-year-old beauty therapist. She was so nervous about her audition that she didn’t even tell anyone about it. She tells the judges that she didn’t tell her family or friends because if she doesn’t make it through then she has nothing to lose. Already her lack of confidence makes the judges and audience skeptical of her.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <strong><a href=#>ALL OF THE PROVOCATIVE OUTFITS THAT GOT AMANDA HOLDEN IN TROUBLE ON ‘BGT’</a></strong></p><p>When she speaks, she is extremely nervous. She fidgets with her hands and barely looks at the judges. This is because she has terrible stage fright.</p><p>“Stage fright is something I’ve always battled with,” she said. “I think I’m just trying to take it day by day as it comes. For me its like your not good enough, thats where most of the nervousness comes from its that people will say no.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fredenham performed “My Funny Valentine” by Richard Rodgers during her audition. When she begins to sing, Simon Cowell pops his head up in shock because he wasn’t expecting such a strong, beautiful voice from someone so shy.</p><p>The audience even stays quiet the whole performance because of how stunned they are while Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon tear up at Fredenham’s voice.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO:<strong> <a href=#>ALL 14 OF THE ‘BRITAINS GOT TALENT’ WINNERS WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</a></strong></p><p>When Fredenham is done singing, she ends up getting a standing ovation from the judges and the audience.</p><p>“This is what I have been waiting for, your voice is like liquid gold, you have such an authentically beautiful voice, you look amazing. You actually don’t even know how good you are,”&nbsp;Cowell assures her.</p><p>The judges all give her <a href=#>four yeses</a> and Cowell calls it the easiest ‘yes’ he’s ever given.</p><p>“I’m gonna sleep so well tonight,” she says backstage to the hosts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-alice-fredenham-now>Where is <strong>Alice Fredenham</strong> Now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Following her audition, Alice was accused of <a href=#>faking stage fright</a>. Viewers had seen her audition three months prior on The Voice, where she had zero stage fright and was very confident. Fredenham denies the accusation.</p><p>She continued strongly in the competition, but did not receive enough public votes to stay, losing to Jack Carroll and Gabz.</p><p>Even though she didn’t win the show, she still continues to sing and has an album called “Under The Covers.”</p><p>Fredenham’s version of “My Funny Valentine,” which she performed in the audition, is currently her most popular song on Spotify.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nick-Cannon-Abby-De-La-Rosa-Mariah-Carey-The-Masked-Singer-scaled-1.jpeg alt="‘Masked Singer’ Host Nick Cannon, Abby De La Rosa Expecting Twins" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>auditions</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKloJ2iYsSqwMdmqq2Zl5p6p77IoJ%2BtZZ2Wu6KzxKxkraddrLy4edOhnGaipZm0pr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
