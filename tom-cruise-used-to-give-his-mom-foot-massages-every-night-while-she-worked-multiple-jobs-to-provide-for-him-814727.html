Her hard work and love gave him the strength to&nbsp;keep going, even when times were tough. Thanks to&nbsp;her support, Tom Cruise overcame obstacles and eventually became the famous star we&nbsp;know today.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;difficult childhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c1/00e/7dd7aa5029a8557841ef7ef244.jpg><p>Even though they made the most out of&nbsp;their limited resources, Cruise’s family faced a&nbsp;stretch of&nbsp;financial struggle during their time in&nbsp;Ottawa, Canada. When Cruise reached the age of&nbsp;14, his mother took the courageous step of&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorcing data-link=tag>divorcing</a> his abusive father. She relocated him and his three sisters to&nbsp;Louiseville, all in&nbsp;pursuit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;brighter future for her family. As&nbsp;the mother of&nbsp;four <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>:</p><p>“You know, women have dreams of&nbsp;having careers and being whatever. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;dream of&nbsp;raising children and enjoying them and having a&nbsp;good <a href=# title="family life" data-link=tag>family life</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d60/7ba/d133145f61a8a29a919f2e6fd3.jpg><p>Jeff Rayner / Coleman-Rayner / East NEWS<span>, </span>Coleman-Rayner / East NEWS</p><p>Tom struggled a&nbsp;lot at&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> during his childhood, having attended 14&nbsp;different schools and being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed with dyslexia</a> at&nbsp;age seven. To&nbsp;help his mom with money, Cruise got a&nbsp;job delivering newspapers. He&nbsp;also gave his mom foot massages every night for about 30&nbsp;minutes after her work.</p><p>Talking about his family life from his perspective, Cruise admitted it&nbsp;was tough to&nbsp;connect with his peers and be&nbsp;open about his past. He&nbsp;shared he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;hard time showing his true feelings, even though he&nbsp;craved love and attention from people. Despite this, he&nbsp;felt like he&nbsp;didn’t really fit in&nbsp;anywhere. Because of&nbsp;all this, Cruise didn’t really like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a>: “I&nbsp;look back upon high school and grade school, and&nbsp;I would never want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back there. Not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;million years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ef/3f1/019bcf52f198dcf69fd271e807.jpg><p>Mary was forced to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her four children alone and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three jobs</a> to&nbsp;support the household. She ventured into selling appliances and even organized electronics conventions, determined to&nbsp;ensure their family’s financial stability.</p><p>Unfortunately, the stress and workload took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;Mary’s <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a>, causing her to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;herniated disc. This meant she could no&nbsp;longer <a href=#>take care of&nbsp;her family alone</a>, and a&nbsp;friend had to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;with them to&nbsp;help with the daily chores.</p><p>For a&nbsp;while, the family lived on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>food stamps</a>. In&nbsp;addition, Tom had to&nbsp;mature more quickly than other children. From the age of&nbsp;11, the <i>Mission Impossible</i> star began working to&nbsp;support his mom and sisters. The boy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delivered newspapers</a>, mowed the lawn at&nbsp;neighbors’ houses, and took cleaning jobs, whatever he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;help out at&nbsp;home.</p><p><h2>Tom and his mom developed a&nbsp;very close connection.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca5/0af/20000759dd8a368d146215588c.jpg><p>Although the relationship between teenagers and their parents can go&nbsp;through some ups and downs, Tom and Mary’s was different. His <a href=#>mother was always his best friend</a>, and he&nbsp;used all the money he&nbsp;earned from his jobs to&nbsp;provide for his family.</p><p>From a&nbsp;young age, Tom had shown interest in&nbsp;acting and was very talented. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;young boy, he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;little sketches of&nbsp;his favorite comedians or&nbsp;imitate animated characters, and his most loyal audience was his mom. So, even though he&nbsp;felt the need to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;her and postpone his dreams, it&nbsp;was Mary who <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>encouraged him to&nbsp;participate</a> in&nbsp;his first play in&nbsp;high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/720/99f/156c05556a8d51d53807c21b98.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>years</a> passed and they settled into their new life, Pfeiffer met Jack South at&nbsp;an&nbsp;electronics convention. By&nbsp;the time Cruise turned sixteen, Pfeiffer and South decided to&nbsp;get married. At&nbsp;first, Cruise felt uneasy about his stepdad because he&nbsp;was really protective of&nbsp;his mom.</p><p>But over time, Cruise saw how much South cared for Pfeiffer and even made a&nbsp;deal with Mary and him, saying he’d make it&nbsp;big as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor within 10&nbsp;years.</p><p>Although Tom earned the recognition of&nbsp;critics and fans in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very short time, it&nbsp;seems that fame never went to&nbsp;the actor’s head, and his strong work ethic has <a href=#>kept him at&nbsp;the top</a> for 40&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;knows he&nbsp;owes much of&nbsp;his accomplishments precisely to&nbsp;his mother, who taught him to&nbsp;work hard and be&nbsp;patient and determined.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3b/35b/8631d353b2880bfabf15146330.jpg><p>Even though Cruise is&nbsp;a&nbsp;major Hollywood star, he&nbsp;always stayed close to&nbsp;Mary. He&nbsp;took her to&nbsp;various red carpet-<a href=#>events</a> and never hesitated to&nbsp;show her off.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mary Lee passed away in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2017</a>. While her health had declined and she had stepped away from the public eye in&nbsp;her final years, her impact on&nbsp;Tom’s heart and career will forever endure. Tom stood by&nbsp;her until the very end, illustrating that repaying the <a href=#>love</a> from our dear ones is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;life’s most profound joys.</p><p>Seeing how deeply Tom looked after his mom warms our hearts, and we&nbsp;must also acknowledge the significant <a href=#>mark</a> he’s creating through his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGwuYycqa6ho5p6tr%2FEnWStp12ctrexjKGgrGWdpLpuss6oq2alkajAorPErGSerpWnxm66yKCfrWWnnbatsYysn55lp6S%2FrLHDZqSupKSeva2xjKOmm6tdqbxuvNGoraKclWKzsL6MoaCmZWhmgXh%2Blmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
