Hotels have recognized this shift and are investing heavily in extended-stay properties, with the accommodation type representing <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>37% of total projects</a> in the development pipeline.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the major hotel players — like Marriott, Hilton and IHG — overseeing these properties may look to their existing guests as a primary target audience for the product, the profile of an extended-stay user looks much more like the audience for vacation rentals like Airbnb and Vrbo. In fact, from a demographic perspective, these audiences are nearly identical: For example, 19% of Gen Z adults use extended-stay hotels compared to 20% who use vacation rentals, and the share of millennials for both is equal at 41%. The household income and regional breakdowns of these audiences also closely mirror each other.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Two demographic areas of difference? Gender and propensity to engage in business travel: Extended-stay hotelgoers are more likely to take work trips than their vacation rental-using counterparts, and also more likely to be male, which makes logical sense as business travelers are more likely to be men. This suggests that extended-stay hotels serve an important purpose for business travelers, who may not be getting what they need in terms of professional setup from a vacation rental, or whose company may be more amenable to booking with a hotel brand from an expense perspective, particularly when <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>regulations related to short-term rentals</a> are in flux.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Aside from this difference, there is a slight divergence in psychographics between the two groups. Extended-stay hotel users are 7 percentage points more likely to say that they “like to pursue a life of challenge, novelty and change” and 6 points more likely to report that they have a “keen sense of adventure” than vacation rental bookers. This difference suggests an opportunity to target these customers with messaging that appeals to their sense of challenge and adventure on property (perhaps connecting them to local experiences or outings for example) to encourage repeat visits and avoid losing their patronage to an adventurous vacation rental alternative.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>This memo </i><i>utilizes data from </i><i>Morning Consult Audience</i><i>, our new product that makes it easy to explore and build thousands of custom audience profiles to better understand your customers.
