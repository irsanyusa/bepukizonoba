He said that the DSS’s recent warnings about the protest had sparked significant concerns.</p><p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the DSS, in a statement on Thursday by its spokesperson, <strong>Peter Afunanya</strong>, described the motive behind the protest as political.</p><p>The DSS in the statement said the protest organised to address economic hardships and governance issues in Nigeria, was allegedly being manipulated by certain individuals and groups.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Lawal, the immediate past APC Chairman in the Scandinavian countries, noted that publicly naming the sponsors would serve several purposes.</p><p>“Firstly, it will clarify whether these individuals or groups genuinely represent the interests and grievances of the Nigerian populace or if they are pursuing personal or political agendas.</p><p>“Transparency is vital to ensure the public can distinguish between legitimate calls for action and potential manipulation by those with nefarious intentions.</p><p>“Moreover, the DSS has expressed concerns that the protest can lead to violence and disrupt public peace,” he said.</p><p>Lawal said that while maintaining security was paramount, it was equally important to respect Nigerians’ fundamental rights.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“But the DSS’s warning, without specific details or evidence, risks being perceived as an attempt to suppress dissent and can further erode public trust in governmental institutions.</p><p>“It is essential to approach this situation with a commitment to democratic principles. President Bola Tinubu’s administration has made efforts to address the underlying issues driving public discontent.</p><p>“The present administration is addressing such economic hardship in Nigeria, social inequities, taking the blame for the non-performance of state and local governments.</p><p>“President Tinubu cannot be tagged as suppressing the protest because he has been seen working around the clock, dialoguing and pleading for more time.</p><p>“There is a need for patience so Nigerians can start enjoying rewards of their patience and fruits of the prosperity foundation the present administration has already been laying,” he added.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Lawal called on all elected representatives, government appointees, traditional leaders, and ruling political party members to engage in open dialogue with the organisers of the protest.</p><p>“Constructive engagement can lead to peaceful resolutions and demonstrate the government’s responsiveness to the needs and concerns of its citizens.</p><p>“While the DSS has a duty to prevent violence and ensure public safety, it must also uphold Nigerians’ constitutional rights.</p><p>“Naming the sponsors of the protest is a step toward transparency and accountability, fostering a more open and democratic society.</p><p>“I appeal to all potential protesters to reconsider their approach and give President Tinubu more time to deliver on his mandate,” Lawal stated.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He urged Nigerians to hold their state and local government leadership accountable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46ap5xllJ6utLzOq5hmm5iesqfAwKKlZq%2BRo8G0ecOsqmasn2K%2FpsLEmqNmq6Cku7S70axkqJ5do661tc6nrqKclWK9s7vTnqqtq1%2Bfx6mElJ2j</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
