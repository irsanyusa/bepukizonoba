After a quick chat with a few network reps, an unconventional decision was made regarding the challenge. The nine remaining teams gave up the luxuries of building on a flat tabletop for an airier workstation. Adding to the LEGO excitement this week was <strong>a special&nbsp;<a href=#>Space Jam&nbsp;promo</a></strong></strong> <strong>featuring lumberjack crooner and season one finalist, Boone Langston trying the challenge himself. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>This week, host Will Arnett had a video conference call with his boss to discuss some ideas for the show. Joining them on the call was this week’s celebrity cameo,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Masked Singer&nbsp;judge Ken Jeong</a>, who admits “FOX puts me in everything they do, even the conference calls.” While Ken offers no help for show ideas, Arnett’s boss has the brilliant idea to have the teams build something completely suspended in the air.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lego-masters-soars-higher-than-ever-before>LEGO Masters&nbsp;Soars Higher Than Ever Before</h2><p>Typically LEGO creations are built on a flat surface or even better, a studded LEGO base plate. This week, the brick artists had to give that up. Instead, they had to build their floating masterpieces off a single LEGO Technic brick suspended from a cable. The brick masters Jamie Berard and Amy Corbett, as usual, wanted to see eye-catching displays of technical skill. In addition, they hoped to see the story told from any angle. The teams wasted no time getting their heads in the clouds with only 10-hours to complete the challenge.</p><p>The pressure was on with so much to consider in the design and <a href=#>the golden brick</a> on the line. Some teams focused on imaginative storytelling. Brothers Mark and Steven whisked us away to a floating gnome forest with their build. Even the recently friended Richard and Dave rewrote the classic tale of “Jack and the Beanstalk.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other teams got their ideas from real-world objects or creatures and just went big. The team of Randall and Syreeta went with a simple concept of a hot air balloon. Friends Michelle and Natalie stuck to their arts and crafts background and built a hanging planter with a macramé accent. By far going the biggest with the challenge were Zack and Wayne. The brothers boldly recreated a massive battle between a whale and giant squid.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRBnHVFtMmZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-brick-masters-who-was-eliminated>The Brick Masters: Who Was Eliminated?</h3><p>After the challenge of building entire structures off of a single, suspended LEGO brick behind them, came the easy part. It was time for the brick masters to make the tough decisions: who to send home and who could gain immunity. There were no major collapses this week making everyone a contender.&nbsp;</p><p>The brother teams of Wayne and Zack along with Mark and Steven were announced as this week’s top builds.&nbsp;A little deja vu to the last time these <a href=#>teams met for the Golden Brick</a>.</p><p>The brick masters commended Mark and Steven for their build being easily readable from afar but even better as you got a closer look at all the details. Their build was also the most balanced amongst all the competitors. Wayne and Zack really wowed the brick masters completing the biggest 10-hour build the show has had. They were also applauded for a high level of detail and how well the story was told from any angle, but the Golden Brick was awarded to Mark and Steven.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone was able to adapt to this unfamiliar scenario of LEGO building in the air. Some struggled with the scaling of their build or didn’t show enough details to complete the storytelling.</p><p>Randall and Syreeta found themselves at the bottom since their hot air balloon was all balloon and no detail. While it grabbed attention from across the room, there was hardly any storytelling upon closer look, and they were eliminated.</p><p>Catch the next episode of ‘LEGO Masters’ next Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FOX</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NUP_193480_12805-1.jpeg alt="Meet the ‘America’s Got Talent’ Season 16 Golden Buzzer Acts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y56eqGWdlsC1sdGsZKuZmaiytHnToZxmm5%2BivabAyK2gqKZdl8ZuvsSipa2qn5nCpLXNoGStoJVitLC4w56lZpqinrCsew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
