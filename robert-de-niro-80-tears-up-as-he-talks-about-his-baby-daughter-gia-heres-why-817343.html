The couple disclosed their daughter’s name as&nbsp;Gia Virginia Chen-De Niro. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gayle King</a>, De&nbsp;Niro happily shared the news, stating that their precious bundle of&nbsp;joy was born on&nbsp;Thursday, April&nbsp;6, weighing 8&nbsp;pounds and 6&nbsp;ounces. As&nbsp;an&nbsp;added delight, an&nbsp;image of&nbsp;their adorable baby girl was also shared during the interview.</p><p>De&nbsp;Niro openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that he&nbsp;anticipated becoming a&nbsp;father again with his girlfriend, Tiffany and that their <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> was deliberately planned.

I’m good with&nbsp;it.” In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;whether parenthood ever becomes easier, the Taxi Driver humorously retorted, “It&nbsp;never gets easier.”</p><p>The acclaimed actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has</a> six other children as&nbsp;well. With his ex-wife Diahnne Abbott, he&nbsp;has Drena, 51, and Raphael, 46. With ex-wife Grace Hightower, he&nbsp;has Elliot, 25, and Helen, 11.

In&nbsp;August 2021, Robert and Tiffany were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spotted</a> together during a&nbsp;romantic vacation in&nbsp;the South of&nbsp;France. Their affection for each other was evident as&nbsp;they held hands while leisurely strolling under the sunshine and later shared kisses aboard a&nbsp;yacht.</p><p>During that time, the esteemed actor was entangled in&nbsp;a&nbsp;contentious <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce battle</a> with his now ex-wife, Grace Hightower. In&nbsp;April 2022, a&nbsp;judge ruled that Robert’s ex-wife would receive an&nbsp;annual sum of&nbsp;$1&nbsp;million and that the couple would split the proceeds after selling their home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e3/cd7/7fc47855a9b673c861306a0d35.png><p>The <a href=#>surprising news</a> about the new addition to&nbsp;his family has been previously revealed when De&nbsp;Niro was asked about how it&nbsp;feels to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;father of&nbsp;six.
