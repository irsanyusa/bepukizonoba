There were big, physical trips across countries and continents, and, in one case, on foot through the untamed woods. And there were heavy, emotional treks to uncover answers about love and loss. In these books, the destination was often less important than the lessons learned along the way. From a <a href=#>bored copywriter in Berlin</a> who follows a K-pop star to Seoul to a <a href=#>girl fleeing a colonial settlement</a>, these protagonists were all searching for something, whether a shot at safety, a sense of purpose, or a chance to finally return home. Their quests were hopeful, daring, and at times devastating. Here, the 10 best fiction books of 2023.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>More:</strong> Read TIME's lists of the best nonfiction books, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">songs</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">albums</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">movies</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV shows</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">podcasts</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video games</a> of 2023.

Tremor, Teju Cole</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/fic-BOC9.png><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The protagonist of Teju Cole’s first novel in over a decade shares many similarities with the author. Like Cole, the incisive Tunde is a Nigerian American artist and photographer who teaches at a prestigious college in New England. Tremor begins in Maine as Tunde hunts for antiques with his wife Sadako while meditating on colonialism as it relates to the objects he sees. Tunde is always pulling at the loose threads of the history that surrounds him, contemplating how the world has been shaped by the past. Forgoing a traditional narrative structure, Tremor takes a philosophical form to investigate everything from how Americans view art to how a marriage can quietly unravel.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> Tremor on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">9.

Y/N begins with an unnamed narrator living in Berlin whose boring job as a copywriter for an artichoke company leaves something to be desired. She spends much of her time in the fantasy worlds inside her head and online, where she writes fan fiction about a popular K-pop star named Moon. When the real-life Moon unexpectedly announces his retirement, the young woman feels compelled to drop everything and go to Seoul in search of the man she views as her soulmate. What ensues is a snarky and astute takedown of internet culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> Y/N on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">8.

There’s an ex-con attempting to understand the world, a Cold War–era maid looking for the son she left behind in North Korea, and a couple living in the U.K. whose quiet existence is complicated by the arrival of a boy at their corner store. Yoon tells the stories of characters at odds with their relationships to home and explores how trauma can linger in the most unexpected ways.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now:</strong> The Hive and the Honey on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">7.
