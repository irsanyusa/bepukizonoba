The news of Harwell’s passing left many fans and friends of the band in shock and mourning.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carson-daly-reflects-on-early-days-with-smash-mouth>Carson Daly Reflects On Early Days With Smash Mouth</h2><p>Daly’s Instagram post, which he shared in two parts, gave us a glimpse into the deep bond he shared with the late musician. In his first post, Daly reminisced about his early days as a DJ on KOME in San Jose, California. At this job, he first crossed paths with Harwell and the up and coming band Smash Mouth in 1995.</p><p>At that time, the band was relatively unknown, unsigned, and had only released an EP. In a heartfelt attempt to support local talent, Daly played Smash Mouth’s song “Nervous In The Alley” repeatedly, and it didn’t take long for the band to rise to fame. Their friendship blossomed, and when Daly moved on to KROQ-LA in 1996, he continued to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">support</a> the band.</p><p>Daly’s support and the band’s undeniable talent eventually earned Smash Mouth a deal with Interscope Records, propelling them to stardom. Daly fondly remembered their journey from humble beginnings to chart-topping success. Smash Mouth’s infectious pop-rock sound, characterized by hits like “All Star” and “Walkin’ on the Sun,” became a staple on the airwaves, solidifying their place in 1990s music history.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Daly has been noticeably absent from television recently. Fans have been concerned about his unexplained hiatus from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Today Show</a>, which began in mid-August.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-carson-daly-shared-a-close-friendship-with-steve-harwell>Carson Daly Shared a Close Friendship With Steve Harwell</h2><p>As the years rolled on, Daly couldn’t help but be aware of the challenges that Harwell faced. Life threw Harwell some devastating curveballs, including the tragic loss of his son in 2001 and battles with addiction. Despite these hardships, Daly continued to root for his friend and kept him in his thoughts and prayers.</p><p>Their paths crossed again in 2016 when Harwell performed at Daly’s 1990s Halloween show on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TODAY</a> Show. The two friends reconnected, sharing laughs and stories like long-lost brothers. Daly also paid tribute to Harwell’s magnetic presence on stage, where he was a force as a frontman, delivering unforgettable performances.</p><p>In closing, Daly expressed his hope that in Harwell’s final moments, he found comfort surrounded by loved ones. He acknowledged that Harwell had left a lasting legacy through his music, which would continue to bring happiness to countless fans. Daly concluded his tribute by welcoming Harwell to a better place, where he could reunite with his late son, Presley, and finally find peace.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_NickJonas_Scott-LegatoGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Nick Jonas Serenades Wife Priyanka Chopra During Jonas Brothers Concert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqprKeeYrGiuNhmp6irpKh6onnHnpirrJaaubV506ugm62kmnqlscOimpqslZl6tbuMrZ%2BeZZyWwaZ50qaYrKBdory2wMdmqqKml5q%2Fbr%2FTnq2eZZiWv7ixy6Vm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
