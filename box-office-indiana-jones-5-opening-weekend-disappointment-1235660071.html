It’ll take a heroic feat, one that would test even an enduring legend like Indiana Jones, for the fifth installment in the decades-old franchise to become profitable in its theatrical run.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It was a disappointing weekend at the box office as “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” a $70 million-budgeted family film from DreamWorks and Universal, cratered in its sixth-place debut with $5.2 million. In addition to “Dial of Destiny” and “Ruby Gillman,” the DC superhero adventure “<a href=# id=auto-tag_the-flash data-tag=the-flash>The Flash</a>” tumbled to the No. 8 spot in its third weekend of release with $5 million, another embarrassing 67% drop. It has yet to cross $100 million domestically, with ticket sales at $99.2 million to date.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” the final adventure to star Harrison Ford as the swashbuckling explorer, added $70 million at the international box office for a global start of $130 million. That’s worse than “The Flash,” which misfired with $75 million internationally and $139 million globally and cost $100 million less to make.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In terms of its domestic debut, the latest “Indiana Jones” didn’t come close to matching its predecessor, 2008’s “Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,” which opened 15 years ago to $100 million. Audiences and critics were lukewarm on “Dial of Destiny,” which earned a “B+” CinemaScore and holds a 68% on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It’ll get a boost on Tuesday’s July 4th holiday, with estimates of $82 million domestically and $152 million worldwide for the five-day frame. But the action-adventure doesn’t have a long runway before Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” (July 12) and Christopher Nolan’s atomic bomb drama “Oppenheimer” (July 21), which cater to similar demographics, open on the big screen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is a weak opening,” says David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research. “Most action-adventure series finish by episode five and that’s happening here.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Ruby Gillman”<strong> </strong>added $7.6 million at the international box office, bringing its worldwide total to $12.8 million. Despite the weak turnout, audiences liked the movie, which has an “A-” CinemaScore and centers on a shy teenager (voiced by “To All the Boys” star Lana Condor) who discovers she’s part of a legendary royal lineage of mythical sea creatures.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Two bright(ish) spots on North American charts were Sony’s theatrical winner “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” which remained in second place with $11.6 million in its fifth weekend of release, and Pixar’s “Elemental,” which took the No. 3 slot with $11.3 million in its third weekend in theaters.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Spider-Verse” has generated $340 million at the domestic box office and crossed the $600 million mark in global ticket sales. And “Elemental,” which hasn’t lived up to Pixar standards, is displaying modest staying power with $88 million in North America and $186 million worldwide. The film looks like it’ll continue to draw in family crowds throughout the summer, but it’ll struggle to justify its $200 million budget.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Jennifer Lawrence’s raunchy R-rated comedy “No Hard Feelings” landed in fourth place with $7.5 million from 3,208 theaters, a 52% decline from its debut. The Sony Pictures movie, which cost $45 million, has grossed $29 million in North America and $20 million at the international box office.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Paramount’s “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” again rounded out the top five, adding $7 million from 2,852 venues in its fourth outing. So far, the seventh “Transformers” installment has earned $136 million at the domestic box office and $381 million globally. It cost $200 million to produce.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere, Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” pulled in a lackluster $3.8 million as the comedic drama expanded to $1,901 theaters. So far, the star-studded film, led by Scarlett Johansson and Jason Schwartzman, has generated $18.1 million in North America and $29 million worldwide. That’s not a bad result for an indie in post-COVID times.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After a series of underwhelming tentpoles to kick off the summer, movie theater owners are holding out hope for July releases like “Mission: Impossible 7,” “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” to fill seats at multiplexes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Audiences are ready for the next big thing,” says Franchise Entertainment Research’s Gross. “And these movies look like they are going to be it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN%2Fjp%2BgpaVfo7K4v46bprFln5uzqq%2FEZqCnnJmWu6J5yailnqtdanqwvMSnoKefXayyprfEp5tmnJmorrG8zqKlraWVo8FufZFsbG9uYGWEcns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
