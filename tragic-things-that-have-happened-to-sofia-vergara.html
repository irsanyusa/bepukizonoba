From bad relationships to devastating deaths in the family, Sofia remains a strong and empowering woman.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tragic-details-about-sofia-vergara-that-will-shock-you>Tragic Details About Sofia Vergara That Will Shock You</h2><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-brother-rafael-was-murdered-in-colombia>Her Brother Rafael was Murdered in Colombia</h2><p>Sofia grew up in Colombia during a time where violence and drug trafficking plagued the country. Her older brother Rafael was shot during an attempted kidnapping in 1998. She called this time in her life a “nightmare.” Sofia decided to move her mother, sister Veronica, and younger brother Julio to Miami as she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pursued a career on television.</a> Her parents divorced in 1993 and her father stayed behind in Colombia and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">passed away in 2009 </a>after ongoing health battles.</p><p>“Mother was like a zombie,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>said in an interview with&nbsp;Parade.</a> “I got a big house and we all lived together. I am so grateful to be in this country.”</p><p>She recalled her brother’s death on America’s Got Talent <a href=#>after an emotional performance</a> by poet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Brandon Leake. </a>Sofia has a tattoo on her wrist of an “R” for Rafael in a touching tribute to him. The 48-year-old was inspired to get this tattoo by the late actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Heath Ledger</a>. She met him on the set of Lords of Dogtown.</p><p>Ledger and Sofia became close friends. He shared his story about he got the acronym KAOS tattooed on his wrist to honor his sisters and his mom. Sadly Ledger passed away in 2008 of a suspected drug overdose. Sofia has her tattoo as a way to honor both Ledger for giving her the idea and her brother’s legacy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-s-younger-brother-julio-suffered-from-drug-addiction><strong>Sofia Vergara’s Younger Brother Julio Suffered From Drug Addiction</strong></h2><p>Sofia’s brother Julio was forever changed by Rafael’s death. They were very close to each other and he went off to college in Michigan before hitting rock bottom. He turned to alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and crack cocaine to cope with the loss. In 2011, Sofia decided that she wanted to get him the help he needed and planned to move him back to Colombia.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a> later reported that Julio had been arrested over 30 times in 10 years. He was arrested for public drinking, petty larceny, marijuana possession, and several other felonies. After being held in a Miami jail for five days, Julio was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deported back to Colombia</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-battled-thyroid-cancer-in-2000>She Battled Thyroid Cancer in 2000</h2><p>Sofia was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2000. She kept her diagnosis under wraps as she was navigating her career as an actress after coming to the U.S. The Colombian beauty did not want to create more stress into her life by making this information public as she battled this disease.</p><p>She first found out that she had cancer after taking her son Manolo to an endocrinologist to be checked for Type one diabetes as her family has a history of the disease. While there, the doctor checked Sofia as well and found a lump in her neck.&nbsp;He suggested that she undergo surgery to have it removed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p>“I felt no symptoms, so I was skeptical about having my thyroid gland removed,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>told Health.</a> “Plus, the surgery is dangerous. If the doctor makes a mistake, you can lose your speech or the mobility in your face. But I did it.”</p><p>Sofia still has to take a Synthroid pill every morning to control her metabolism. She also regularly gets her blood checked to make sure she is in good health. After the surgery, she had iodine radiation because the cancer was not completely removed. Throughout this time, her family took care of Manolo who was 10 years old as she recovered from the painful surgery.</p><p>“When you go through something like this, it’s hard, but you learn a lot from it,” she added. “Your priorities change. You don’t sweat the small stuff. And it had a good ending.”</p><p>Sofia helps others with cancer in her native Colombia get the treatment they need through the many charities that she works with. She even helped a young boy who needed <a href=#>an urgent bone marrow transplant</a> to get the care he needed in the United States. Giving back to Colombia has always been something that Sofia has been passionate about, even though something completely tragic happened to her family there.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-and-her-ex-nick-loeb-have-been-involved-in-a-heated-court-battle-over-frozen-embryos>Sofia <strong>Vergara and Her Ex Nick Loeb Have Been Involved in a Heated Court Battle Over Frozen Embryos</strong></h2><p>Sofia got engaged to Nick Loeb in 2012. The pair <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">froze embryos through in vitro fertilization</a> prior to their breakup in 2014. The embryos were frozen in California. They did <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sign a contract</a> in 2013 stating that the decision to bring the embryos to life needs to be agreed upon mutually. A long legal battle ensued after Nick wanted to bring the embryos to life via surrogate when they broke up.</p><p>The legal battle has gone on for years but now a Los Angeles Superior Court judge has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>barred Nick from using any of the frozen embryos.</a>&nbsp;Sofia was finally granted a permanent injunction this year, which means&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the final ruling.</a>&nbsp;After&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filing several lawsuits in the past,</a>&nbsp;it became clear that Nick wanted to bring the embryos to life via surrogate while Sofia did not after their breakup.</p><p>It looks like Sofia can finally close the door on this chapter and has been happily married to actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Manganiello</a> since 2015. Through everything, she still manages to dominate television, especially after playing the role of Gloria on the hit show Modern Family for 11 seasons. Plus, Sofia was named the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highest paying actress</a> on television. Now, she is judging her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a> of America’s Got Talent. She is proof that going through all of these hard things has only made her stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thumbnail_PhotoByMichaelBeckerFoxTraePattonNBCEricMcCandlessABC_FoxNBCUniversalMediaVillageDisneyGEC.jpg alt="Can a Contestant’s Song Choice Ruin their Chances on a Talent Show?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706uYoKGTYsGptc2gqmasmJbBbrTAr5xmoJGlvaa6xJ1kraddqLyntcBmrZ6ql5a%2Fons%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
