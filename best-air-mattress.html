From light and portable mattresses best for frequent travel to self-inflating beds that mimic real mattresses and box springs, air mattresses are a cost-effective way to stay comfortable on camping trips, host guests over the holidays, or simply buy yourself some time between traditional mattress purchases. Check out some of our top picks below.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-air-mattress>How to choose the best air mattress</h2><p>The best air mattress for you will depend mostly on your individual preferences and how you’re going to use it.</p><h3>Use</h3><p>A huge factor in determining which type of air mattress is best for you, is the primary use. Is the mattress for you in a temporary situation? Is it for house guests? Will you use it for camping trips? Does it need to work for your kids?</p><h3>Size</h3><p>Just like you would consider your preferred size when reviewing the <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattresses</a>, size is an important factor for air mattresses as well. If you are shopping primarily for guests, a full or queen size mattress may be best, while if you’re looking for an easily portable mattress, the smaller the better.</p><h3>Storage</h3><p>Storage and space can also be a factor if you are transporting your air mattress frequently, or if you have limited space where you live. For example, most closets can store up to a king size air mattress if necessary, but that’s probably not the size you’d want to frequently toss in the back of your car.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-air-mattresses->Our top picks for the best air mattresses</h2><h3>Best air mattress for camping: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Coleman SupportRest Double-High Air Mattress</a></h3><p>The <a rel=alternate href=#>best camping mattress</a> depends on whether you prioritize comfort or convenience and portability—the Coleman SupportRest Double-High Air Mattress comes with a little of both.

For maximum comfort, look for double-height air mattresses, which are meant to mimic the height of a box spring and mattress of a traditional bed. Make sure you pair your air mattress with the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bed sheets</a> for additional comfort.</p><h3>Is an air bed good for daily use?</h3><p>Air mattresses, or air beds, are generally not recommended for daily use long term. Air mattresses are not as supportive as traditional mattresses and they don’t last as long.</p><h3>What height air mattress should I get?</h3><p>This will depend on the primary use for your mattress. Double-height air mattresses more closely mimic standard mattresses, and are therefore better for guests or longer term use. Single-height air mattresses are better for camping and travel because they are light and easily portable.</p><h3>Is it OK to sleep on an air mattress long term?</h3><p>If you can, it’s generally recommended that you invest in a standard mattress for long-term use. There are several risks in using an air mattress long term, including temperature regulation, body support, and maintenance, just to name a few. Air mattresses used daily also won’t last as long as a standard mattress.
