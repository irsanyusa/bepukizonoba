She took care of our kids very well, prepared meals, kept the house tidy and did all she could to make us comfortable.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I was very appreciative of her help and kept thanking her for her assistance. Most nights after the kids had gone to bed, we would sit together in the parlour watching movies or just chatting but I was surprised one night when Naomi steered the conversation to sex.</p><p>We chatted about this and that before she blurted out how much she loved sex and how she has not had sex in a long while. She kept talking about what she loved a man to do to her in bed, the sex positions she loved most, how she likes a man who can go up to five rounds a night.</p><p>Though I was uncomfortable with the direction the conversation was going, I could not tell her to stop, so she went on and on and ended up by saying she was so horny that night. Then she did what I never expected from her as she started pleasuring herself, moaning softly and looking at me with sedated eyes.</p><p>I knew it was a clear invitation for me to have sex with her and I must confess that though I was seriously tempted, I was able to restrain myself and went to my room where I locked the door and slept off.</p><p>Since that day, Naomi has not hidden the fact that she wanted me to have sex with her. Even when my wife came back and she had to go back to her place, Naomi has continued to bombard me with raunchy text messages, sending me her nude photos, calling me all the time, telling me how much she wants to sleep with me.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I don't want to tell my wife what has been going on because that will cause serious friction between them and I don't want that to happen.</p><p>I don't know how else to tell Naomi to stay away from me.</p><p>Dear readers, having gone through James's dilemma on Morning Teaser today, what do you think he should do to stop Naomi from harassing him?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHyuu9GnoKefXamyor%2FEq2SmsV2stqex0maZnqukYrOztcSnm2aho2KxsLXNoGSerpWnxrW0yKeeZqyfYsCmsNScnGallWTFd77Nqqtu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
