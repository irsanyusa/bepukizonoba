During his numerous trips to Europe, he acquired state-of-the-art cameras and appointed at least two official court photographers.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The history of Iran is closely related to photography. The first photographic images appeared in this country in the mid-19th century. The first daguerreotype cameras were brought to Iran at the request of Shah Mohammad Qajar from Russia and England.</p><p>The first photograph in Iran was taken in mid-December 1842, according to Jules Richard's notes. Iranian <strong>Prince Malek Qassem Mirza</strong> and Frenchman <strong>Jules Richard</strong> are considered the pioneers of photography in Iran.</p><p>Unfortunately, apart from one photo, none of the Iranian daguerreotypes have survived. Some of them, including portraits of <strong>Mohammad Shah</strong> and <strong>Prince Nasser al-Din Shah</strong>, were given to Kamal-al-Molk, who used them to create painted portraits.</p><p>At the beginning of the 20th century, with the advent of modern technology and access to cameras, Iranian photographers began to document the everyday life of their compatriots in more detail. Photography, which previously served kings and elites, has become an indispensable tool for documenting history and culture.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>One of the first selfies in Iran was captured in the harem mirror. Shah Nasseredin, known for his love of photography, contributed to the development of this art in his country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMPOq6Odq12kuaWx0q1krJ2cm7ame9htsZuwYa0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
