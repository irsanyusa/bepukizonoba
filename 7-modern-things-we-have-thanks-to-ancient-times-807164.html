Most of&nbsp;those things are considered innovations of&nbsp;the modern age, but their origins can be&nbsp;traced back to&nbsp;our ancient ancestors. Some inventions from the ancient era were so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>controversial </a>that they couldn’t be&nbsp;accepted because of&nbsp;the limitations of&nbsp;the time. However, over time they became a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the everyday routine and shaped the world we&nbsp;know today.</p><p>To&nbsp;show you how much ancient society has influenced our modern life, <strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;7&nbsp;ancient inventions that we&nbsp;still use today.</p><p><h2>1. Fast food restaurants existed in&nbsp;Pompeii.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd9/51e/265cda50ed936dc714d23fcb6f.jpg><p>We&nbsp;usually think of&nbsp;fast-food restaurants as&nbsp;modern inventions. It&nbsp;turns out that street food was present in&nbsp;ancient times as&nbsp;well. Archaeologists studying Pompeii recently discovered a&nbsp;Roman version of&nbsp;fast food restaurant called a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thermopolium</a>. Typical dishes included duck, salty fish, baked cheese, and honey-roasted rodents. Today, visitors cannot enjoy delicacies from the ancient era, but they can walk through the site and admire the fresco paintings.</p><p><h2>2. Makeup originates from ancient Egypt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ecd/e9b/61237e5ec4a3524544fd2c8e73.jpg><p>The history of&nbsp;<a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> dates back to&nbsp;ancient times&nbsp;— it&nbsp;came into use around <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4,000&nbsp;BCE</a>. Ancient Egyptians used to&nbsp;make makeup from natural ingredients, like malachite, kohl, red ochre, or&nbsp;henna. The time-consuming process of&nbsp;preparation included mixing the minerals into a&nbsp;powder and then combining them with a&nbsp;binder ingredient&nbsp;— usually animal fat. However, makeup wasn’t used solely for aesthetical purposes, like it&nbsp;is&nbsp;today. Namely, Egyptians believed that it&nbsp;offered them protection against evil since eyes without makeup were more vulnerable to&nbsp;the Evil Eye.</p><p><h2>3. Alarm clocks were invented in&nbsp;ancient Greece.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/801/dfa/55b7b95ea4825b86c8758b6c58.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are so&nbsp;used to&nbsp;technology that we&nbsp;probably cannot imagine how we&nbsp;would wake up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning without setting the alarm on&nbsp;our mobile phones. On&nbsp;the other side, people in&nbsp;the past used to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;at&nbsp;sunrise and sometimes they had to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;before that. That’s why the Greek philosopher Plato made the first version of&nbsp;an&nbsp;alarm clock. He&nbsp;used a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>water clock</a>, a&nbsp;popular clock in&nbsp;Ancient Greece, with an&nbsp;added feature. To&nbsp;announce the beginning of&nbsp;his lectures at&nbsp;dawn, Plato attached whistles that produced a&nbsp;sound similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;water organ.</p><p><h2>4. The oldest door locks were made by&nbsp;the ancient Egyptians.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/398/33b/87b4ea593581ef23c187c2f9b6.jpg><p>The oldest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>door lock</a> was made around 4,000&nbsp;BCE by&nbsp;Egyptians. Ancient locks were similar to&nbsp;pin-tumbler locks but much bigger than those we&nbsp;use today&nbsp;— sometimes reaching up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;length. And in&nbsp;contrast to&nbsp;the latter locks that were made out of&nbsp;wood and metal, ancient Egyptians used only wood, even for their keys.</p><p><h2>5. Ancient Romans had central heating.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cf/2f9/9a6ffd559c903b4b6942f2a5d5.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Central heating</a> dates back to&nbsp;ancient Rome. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hypocaust </a>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;system of&nbsp;central heating that produces and circulates hot air through pipes below the floor. The heat was produced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire. According to&nbsp;archaeologists’ findings, this heating system was present in&nbsp;baths and upper-class homes.</p><p><h2>6. Sumerians developed the first writing system.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd9/690/55f0da5d8f8a984e2eb80d90a1.jpg><p>Even though we&nbsp;use modern and simplified letters today, we&nbsp;should thank Sumerians for inventing the first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>writing system</a>. In&nbsp;the beginning, written communication came down to&nbsp;simple pictures called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pictographs</a>. As&nbsp;the human need for writing down more abstract ideas grew, people started combining pictographs into more complex symbols. Through the centuries, the writing system continued to&nbsp;evolve and today we&nbsp;have what we&nbsp;call a&nbsp;modern alphabet.</p><p><h2>7. Old Greeks used to&nbsp;make pancakes for breakfast.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4a9/803/9185755324bdc3e34e61d93b47.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;analyses of&nbsp;starch grains on&nbsp;30,000-year-old grinding tools, scientists supposed that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Stone Age</a> cooks were making flour and mixing it&nbsp;with water to&nbsp;make something similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;pancake mixture. However, the first recorded mention of&nbsp;<a href=# title=pancakes data-link=tag>pancakes</a> dates back to&nbsp;ancient Greece. Greek physicist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Galen </a>wrote many books on&nbsp;medicine and health, but one of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;diet. It&nbsp;turns out that pancakes are not a&nbsp;typical American breakfast as&nbsp;it’s often thought today&nbsp;— according to&nbsp;Galen’s writings, ancient Greeks also enjoyed this sweet breakfast.</p><p>Can you imagine life without these inventions?
