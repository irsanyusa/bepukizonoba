If not, did you take my advice and buy one yet? You need to: This seated rear-entry position is the perfect shower choice if you like <a href=# id=cc141328-add8-3e48-ae39-2f51b839127c>girl-on-top</a> . <strong>Do It:</strong> Have your partner sit on the bench with feet on the floor. Facing away from them, sit on their lap, straddling them (you choose how wide to spread your legs based on your stability). As you pump up and down, your hands will be free to play with your clit or any other erogenous zones. You can even have your partner hold your wrists so you can lean forward and go at it at an angle. Fun!

Grind against your partner, bracing the wall for balance if need be.The pressure of his pubic bone against your clitoris should feel pretty darn stimulatingbut if your knees or legs start to hurt, try pretzeling them behind your partner's back. Emily Schiff-Slater</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7db21340-95fc-4763-a07c-9e34ce3a94a3 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/vBCktktTURBXy9jYjhmOGRhZC0wMzJjLTQ1MmMtOWJkZi01NzE1ZGU5ZWU5NTcucG5nkZUCzQMAzQMAwsM></span><p>4) Upstanding Citizen This position might also be easiest with a shower shelf seat, but thats not completely necessary. That said, you may not want to start with this positionthink of it more like your finale. <strong>Do It:</strong> With your back pressed against the wall, have your partner enter you from the front: You can wrap both your legs around their waist, or if thats too slippery in the shower, try dropping one foot to the floor and leaving one lifted.

You have to have a thicker-rimmed shower/bathtub situation for this position to work, but you could also bring in a temporary bench. <strong>Do It:</strong> Rest on your hip and forearm on one side of the tub, shower shelf, or bench, and press your thighs together. Have your partner stand behind you and enter, keeping your legs closed for a tighter hold as he thrusts.

The change in angle adds a stimulating twist to a shower standard, and the added sensation of warm water on your back definitely doesnt hurt.

You get some deep P-in-the-V action (go ahead and touch your clit, or have him reach one hand around to do it himself), he gets to rest (a bit), and you both get a break from all the weird wet kissing. Because let's be honest...warm water never tastes good (nope, not even during sex). <strong>Do It:</strong> Have your partner sit on the edge of the tub or your handy bench, then sit on top of him, facing away. Simple! Emily Schiff-Slater</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0f1fd48f-b40d-42f9-a407-d02797d204ec data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/PN-ktktTURBXy9hZmNhZGM2MS0yMzg4LTQ3MGQtYmVkMS02YjI3OWM5MzAzZDkucG5nkZUCzQMAzQH_wsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>8) The Caboose No one in their right mind would tell you to have sex lying down in the shower (hello, drowning?). But there's no reason you can't have sex sitting down, on the shower floor. In fact, there's every reason TO go for it: You can't fall if you're already on flat ground. <strong>Do It:</strong> Position the shower head so that it will hit your bodies (not faces), then have your partner sit on the shower floor, hands behind him to prop him up. Then sit in front of him and scooch your hips until you're sitting on top of him. Note: You'll be the one doing most of the riding (and pro tip: circular grinding) here, since his tush hitting the hard tile over and over won't feel so good. Show him what you've got!

A big height difference. So to make up for any gaps, this should be your go-to. <strong>Do It:</strong> Prop yourself onto the tub ledge or bench and have your partner enter you while you hold onto the closest surface. If you're completely stable, place your feet on his chest, in front of his shoulders, to better control his tempo and depth of thrusts. Emily Schiff-Slater</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-630ad709-c31e-4717-81fb-471cfede894e data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/dEpktktTURBXy8xMDE5ZmI5ZS05Y2ViLTRiOTgtYTBkYi01Nzk2NzQ4NGI5ZDYucG5nkZUCzQMAzQL-wsM></span><p>10) Wheelbarrow If you're feeling a little more ambitious (and #WHstrong), consider the wheelbarrow position. Word of caution, though: You definitely want that non-slip bath mat and to point the water away from your head. (So you can breathe...okay, pant.) <strong>Do It:</strong> Get on your hands and feet, and have your partner pick you up by the pelvis. Then, wrap your thighs around their waist for support as your partner thrusts. This position allows for some super-deep penetration, and the warm water hitting your body at the same time will feel ah-mazing.
