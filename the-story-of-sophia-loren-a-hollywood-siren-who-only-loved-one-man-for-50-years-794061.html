And even if&nbsp;you’re <a href=# title=lucky data-link=tag>lucky</a> enough to&nbsp;meet this person, it’s unknown how long your <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> will last. But don’t immediately think that it&nbsp;won’t last long. Love can stay alive for 20, 30, or&nbsp;even more years. And you might have doubts, but we&nbsp;are ready to&nbsp;provide you with actual proof that these words are true by&nbsp;showing the love between Sophia Loren and Carlo Ponti&nbsp;— a&nbsp;love that lasted half a&nbsp;century.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> admires this story of&nbsp;the great actress and her only lover. The story of&nbsp;true love, the strength of&nbsp;the human spirit, and how they, together, overcame life’s difficulties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc3/1eb/8608a356d19192f5fa02773c6a.jpg><p>Sophia Loren met the love of&nbsp;her life, Carlo Ponti, as&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;young 16-year-old girl</strong>. But at&nbsp;first he&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;producer for her. He&nbsp;took an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;her training: he&nbsp;taught her manners, got rid her of&nbsp;accent, made her read books about art, and insisted she learn English. He&nbsp;protected her and took care of&nbsp;her. And soon a&nbsp;<strong>strong feeling swallowed the both of&nbsp;them</strong>, despite their 22&nbsp;year age difference. And it&nbsp;was love that helped them overcome the many obstacles to&nbsp;happiness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7a3/ac1/d3363857098ff07cfd23ca15aa.jpg><p>The first test was that <strong>Carlo Ponti was already married</strong> and had 2&nbsp;children. At&nbsp;that time, it&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;obtain permission to&nbsp;divorce from the Vatican. But no&nbsp;one wanted to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;him, and so&nbsp;the lovers had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip. <strong>They went to&nbsp;Mexico </strong>in&nbsp;1957, where Ponti divorced his wife and married Loren. And it&nbsp;seemed like they should’ve been happy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62a/469/8eb08f57c480792061cdadf629.jpg><p>But after returning home, they spouses were faced with new problems. In&nbsp;Italy, their <strong><a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> wasn’t recognized as&nbsp;legal</strong>. Ponti was accused of&nbsp;bigamy, and Lauren of&nbsp;illegal cohabitation. They didn’t even have the right to&nbsp;appear together in&nbsp;public. But not wanting to&nbsp;follow the rules of&nbsp;society and end their relationship, the couple left the country and <strong>lived in&nbsp;exile for many years </strong>while they tried to&nbsp;restore justice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/65a/3fe/3d93465f48b9d1ed865e6b9b6e.jpg><p>Attempts to&nbsp;resolve this issue were unsuccessful and in&nbsp;the end the couple went to&nbsp;France and <strong>acquired French citizenship</strong>. Ponti’s ex-wife also had to&nbsp;change her citizenship to&nbsp;French in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;file for divorce. And finally, in&nbsp;1966, Sophia and Carlo got married again. This time their <strong>marriage was official</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0a/b22/5163bc596b8b5df94c974231fb.jpg><p>But Loren didn’t just want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;married woman, she wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> with children and <strong>dreamed of&nbsp;being a&nbsp;mother</strong>. Unfortunately, this wasn’t that simple. The actress had <strong>2&nbsp;miscarriages</strong>, after which she underwent hormonal treatment. And it&nbsp;was worth&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dcb/3ff/9661945a80998d89c5eae9fe55.jpg><p>Sophia became pregnant at&nbsp;34&nbsp;years old, but doctors had her on&nbsp;bed rest as&nbsp;a&nbsp;precaution. She decided to&nbsp;follow their advice and <strong>led a&nbsp;reclusive lifestyle</strong> from a&nbsp;hotel room in&nbsp;Geneva for months. And on&nbsp;the 29th of&nbsp;December 1968 she <strong>gave birth to&nbsp;their first son</strong> Carlo Ponti Jr. And 4&nbsp;years later on&nbsp;the 6th of&nbsp;January 1973 she gave birth to&nbsp;their second son Edoardo Ponti.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67e/489/cc54655b168c046f0efb263985.jpg><p>Carlo Ponti was her husband, friend, father, producer, and lover. He&nbsp;<strong>made her into what she&nbsp;is</strong>, and together they steadfastly withstood all the blows of&nbsp;fate. They were happy, they loved each other, and <strong>stayed together for half a&nbsp;century</strong> until the very moment when, in&nbsp;2007, Carlo Ponti died of&nbsp;pulmonary complications. That year was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their golden wedding anniversary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e3/65b/58e3ff599cbe8a3d357d2796fc.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you believe in&nbsp;falling in&nbsp;love for life?
