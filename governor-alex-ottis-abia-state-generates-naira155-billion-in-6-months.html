He also said that in 2023, there was a slight increase when the present administration came in and figures showing a significant increase were recorded in the state’s IGR.</p><p>Akpara said that the monthly average revenue is indeed a crucial metric for understanding income patterns because there are times when it could either increase or decrease.</p><p>“The way revenue comes in, you cannot say your IGR will be ₦3 billion.</p><p>“There is something called monthly average revenue, if you look at monthly average revenue in June 23 to June 29, it was ₦2.5billion.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“If June 23 to June 29 had an average revenue of ₦2.5 billion, that provides a clearer picture of the consistent income flow during that period.</p><p>“This means there might be a time when one would do ₦3 billion there might be a time one would do ₦2.1 billion</p><p>“As at July 1 to July 6, we were doing ₦2.7 billion as an average, and this indicates that IGR is cyclical. It has a cycle of how it runs,” Akpara added.</p><p>He said that the government had set a target for itself in monthly revenue generation as an encouragement to boost the state’s IGR.</p><p>According to him, beyond the state’s budget, the government had given itself the target to generate ₦4.3 billion average monthly and a target of ₦52.4 billion by the end of the year.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“We have ourselves set a target that is far away from what is in the budget so that it will ginger us to make sure we meet the target.</p><p>“But in the budget, it is not what we have but we are looking up to this to be able to meet the target stated in the budget,” he stated.</p><p>Also, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Publicity, <strong>Ferdinand Ekeoma</strong>, said that the government had set up a multipurpose task force as a mechanism to ensure that taxes were paid effectively.</p><p>“For the fact that we are doing these, it means we are going to experience a consistent increase in the revenue generation.</p><p>“We expect to do far better than we are doing at the moment,” Ekeoma noted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyou9WeqaenomKurbHXZqatrJmoeqKuyJpkrKyRqbJus8SnnKuZpJrAbrrAoqmaaWVqeqO1y6WgqKZdnrtugoympqesmKh8drnPbmukpg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
