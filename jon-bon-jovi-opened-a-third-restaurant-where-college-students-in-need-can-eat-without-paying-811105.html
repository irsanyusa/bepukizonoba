He&nbsp;and his team were able to&nbsp;open 3&nbsp;community restaurants that are there for people who are hungry and who can dine for free. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>past story,</a> we&nbsp;covered the opening of&nbsp;2&nbsp;restaurants. The JBJ Foundation has not only helped people but also touched the hearts of&nbsp;citizens worldwide. Here are some of&nbsp;the latest updates about the foundation.</p><p><h2>Where the first solid and caring foundation was established</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14c/f78/111eaa550292a21f281cdfb944.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The JBJ Foundation</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-profit organization led by&nbsp;Jon Bon Jovi. This organization started way back in&nbsp;2000 to&nbsp;help underprivileged citizens in&nbsp;the United States. A&nbsp;few years later, their mission grew and reached <a href=# title=Africa data-link=tag>Africa</a>. JBJ Soul Kitchen is&nbsp;a&nbsp;community kitchen, and as&nbsp;of&nbsp;now, they have already served<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> 155,000+&nbsp;</a>meals, with&nbsp;54% earned meals by&nbsp;volunteering and&nbsp;46% paid with donations.</p><p>This kitchen has aided millions of&nbsp;hungry people and has a&nbsp;simple motto: “All are welcome at&nbsp;our table,” for people who can’t afford meals&nbsp;— who can dine in&nbsp;for free. They don’t have any <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prices</a> on&nbsp;their menu, and if&nbsp;people are hungry and don’t have any money, they have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;one hour of&nbsp;labor work in&nbsp;the restaurant, which is&nbsp;equivalent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;3-course meal.</p><p><h2>The third community restaurant is&nbsp;now open</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b69/523/643057593a850751568eb5da92.jpg><p>The free 3-course meal is&nbsp;made with fresh ingredients that are served hot. This is&nbsp;the case for 2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>restaurants</a> that have been opened, one in&nbsp;Red Bank, New Jersey, and the other in&nbsp;Toms River, New Jersey. The restaurants are always buzzing with people, they are making a&nbsp;profit but, at&nbsp;the same time, doing good deeds for their fellow people. People can donate, volunteer, or&nbsp;even be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the team. They are always open to&nbsp;more helping hands.</p><p>Now, they have opened their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>third restaurant</a> at&nbsp;Rutgers University. The university and the JBJ Foundation have worked together to&nbsp;make this happen. “Now what we&nbsp;realize is&nbsp;that there were kids in&nbsp;colleges that were hungry,” says Bon Jovi. This is&nbsp;to&nbsp;assist students who cannot afford a&nbsp;hot and delicious meal&nbsp;— with the opening of&nbsp;this restaurant, many students will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fill their stomachs with delicious food without worrying about paying the bill.</p><p><h2>The outstanding impact of&nbsp;JBJ Foundation in&nbsp;2022</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/90a/483/134f965222ba8e3a456f1544a0.jpg><p>The latest update from the JBJ Soul Kitchen in&nbsp;2022&nbsp;is that, based on&nbsp;the statistics, they were able to&nbsp;serve 24,000 meals through partnerships, 15,000 volunteering hours, and&nbsp;58% of&nbsp;their meals were served to&nbsp;people who are <a href=# title=needy data-link=tag>needy</a> between the 2&nbsp;locations opened. Now, the Soul Kitchen is&nbsp;open for donations for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hope center</a> for the winter season.</p><p>The organization’s<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> goal </a>is&nbsp;“to&nbsp;recognize and maximize the human potential in&nbsp;those affected by&nbsp;hunger, poverty, and homelessness by&nbsp;offering assistance in&nbsp;establishing programs that provide food and affordable housing while supporting social services and job training programs.”</p><p><h2>Their mission is&nbsp;rewarded with new partnerships and awards.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0c/dc9/83c8775247a52d4b988e8698e1.jpg><p>JBJ Soul Kitchen has received a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;new <a href=# title=awards data-link=tag>awards</a>, partnerships, and new milestones. They received <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Trip Advisor Travelers’ Choice Award for 2022</a> for both restaurants, they received a&nbsp;grant from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kohl’s Cares</a> through their Community with Heart Program, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Naloxone Administration</a> lent a&nbsp;hand to&nbsp;all staff members, and now they are certified trainers. Moreover, there were multiple fundraisers that donated funds to&nbsp;the restaurants to&nbsp;continue their good deeds.</p><p>Their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mission</a> is&nbsp;to&nbsp;help break the cycle of&nbsp;hunger, poverty, and homelessness, one SOUL at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. With this, they are one step closer to&nbsp;achieving that goal where strangers can dine&nbsp;in, bond, and form a&nbsp;strong foundation for a&nbsp;relationship, where people can feel that everyone around them is&nbsp;warm and friendly, just like family.</p><p>Would you volunteer at&nbsp;these restaurants if&nbsp;given the opportunity?
