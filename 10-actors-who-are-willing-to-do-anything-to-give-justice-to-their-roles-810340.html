Sometimes, actors undergo intense training or&nbsp;physical transformations for the sake of&nbsp;their craft. And here are some celebrities who went the extra mile to&nbsp;ensure they portrayed their roles perfectly.</p><p><h2>1. Matt Damon in&nbsp;<i>The Informant!</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05d/073/5a99ca5ac88252dc1f8f481403.jpg><p><i>The Bourne Identity </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> had to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;his fit body and gain almost 30&nbsp;lbs to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a> the role of&nbsp;biochemist Mark Whitacre. “It&nbsp;was very, very easy to&nbsp;gain <a href=# title=weight data-link=tag>weight</a>. It&nbsp;was very, very fun,” <a href=# title="Matt Damon" data-link=tag>Matt Damon</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>. “I&nbsp;just ate everything&nbsp;I could see.” And what he&nbsp;saw included lots of&nbsp;McDonald’s meals and junk food. “I&nbsp;wouldn’t do&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>more</a> than&nbsp;30 [lb], though&nbsp;— that would start to&nbsp;hurt.”</p><p><h2>2. Brie Larson in&nbsp;<i>Room</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/017/699/63a60951c38fc6e16a67dac27f.jpg><p>When Brie Larson took on&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>role</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who was held as&nbsp;a&nbsp;prisoner inside a&nbsp;shed, she decided to&nbsp;put herself in&nbsp;her character’s shoes. She isolated herself for a&nbsp;month and dug deep to&nbsp;learn more about the trauma resulting from captivity.</p><p>She also got into her character’s mind and wrote 3&nbsp;diaries as&nbsp;her at&nbsp;ages 10, 14, and 17. “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;stream of&nbsp;consciousness a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the time. I’d get really into it&nbsp;and get stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;10-year-old mind for hours at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time,” Larson shared. But it&nbsp;was all worth the effort, as&nbsp;her performance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earned</a> her the coveted Oscar award.</p><p><h2>3. Tom Hardy in&nbsp;<i>Bronson</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1da/1df/9087985f16b10bf05597474300.jpg><p>Before filming the movie <i>Bronson</i>, <a href=# title="Tom Hardy" data-link=tag>Tom Hardy</a> had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lose</a> 27&nbsp;lbs for a&nbsp;previous role. But when he&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the lead actor for the biopic about the “most violent prisoner in&nbsp;Britain,” Hardy had to&nbsp;regain all the weight he&nbsp;had shed and more.</p><p>“I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;quickly put a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;weight on&nbsp;my&nbsp;forearms, chest, and neck,” he&nbsp;explained. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;built muscle by&nbsp;doing bodyweight exercises, resistance training, and chugging some ice cream and sodas for good measure.</p><p><h2>4. Mariah Carey in&nbsp;<i>Precious</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59f/8b3/68f45954b287fb7ea7a31956f9.jpg><p>The notoriously high-maintenance diva has always looked fabulous and blinged&nbsp;up. But the image she maintained for years was stripped down to&nbsp;the bare minimum when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> the role of&nbsp;Mrs. Wess<i>. </i>To&nbsp;convince audiences that she was an&nbsp;empathetic woman helping a&nbsp;troubled teenager in&nbsp;the ‘80s, the production team gave her eyebags, a&nbsp;mustache, gray <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a>, and even bound her breasts.</p><p><h2>5. Dwayne Johnson in&nbsp;<i>Black Adam</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/700/67e/e7c5fe509eb58930e59d3ed2cb.jpg><p>The Rock’s body has always been ripped, but the former wrestler had to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;more work for his superhero bod. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, he&nbsp;shared that they removed all the muscle padding and put in&nbsp;the real work.</p><p>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;chefs and a&nbsp;conditioning coach who calculated the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>precise</a> macronutrient count needed for his desired physique. Johnson also said that his transformation into Black Adam was “one of&nbsp;the most grueling, intense, demanding commitments of&nbsp;my&nbsp;entire career.”</p><p><h2>6. Lupita Nyong’o in&nbsp;<i>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc1/f31/e7e026520f86c96b13d140e62a.jpg><p>The Oscar winner’s role as&nbsp;Nakia in&nbsp;the Marvel movie involved some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sequences</a> filmed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Atlantis-like setting. And Lupita Nyong’o gave her followers a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;her intense preparation for the part by&nbsp;sharing some behind-the-scenes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clips</a>. Her training included completing a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;underwater drills, like crawling and walking under a&nbsp;pool. And as&nbsp;if&nbsp;that wasn’t challenging enough, she had to&nbsp;carry dumbbells with her.</p><p><h2>7. Chris Hemsworth in&nbsp;<i>Limitless</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b11/c99/a0990a5280bac4c0a39e7062df.jpg><p>The actor’s latest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>project</a> is&nbsp;not really a&nbsp;movie but rather a&nbsp;documentary about challenging the human mind and body to&nbsp;explore life and longevity. The actor admitted that his previous movie preparations&nbsp;— like getting fit and having abs&nbsp;— felt superficial compared to&nbsp;this one.</p><p>Hemsworth fasted for 4&nbsp;days to&nbsp;test his limits, plunged into icy cold waters, dangled over a&nbsp;canyon, and “aged” himself. He&nbsp;wore an&nbsp;MIT-designed suit, which restricted his hearing, vision, and movement, thereby giving him a&nbsp;preview of&nbsp;how he&nbsp;would feel if&nbsp;he&nbsp;reached his eighties.</p><p><h2>8. Michelle Williams in&nbsp;<i>My&nbsp;Week with Marilyn</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db6/77d/670dee516389b3a1b501d52fee.jpg><p>Evan Agostini / Invision / East News<span>, </span>East News</p><p>To&nbsp;embody an&nbsp;icon like Marilyn Monroe, Williams did her homework&nbsp;— she devoured autobiographies, letters, and listened to&nbsp;interviews. But to&nbsp;mimic Monroe’s trademark wiggle, Williams decided to&nbsp;tie a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belt</a> around her knees while practicing the famous strut.</p><p><h2>9. Viola Davis in&nbsp;<i>The Woman King</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b10/18d/bb2e085b24ba7cefa110d1fcbb.jpg><p>The <i>How to&nbsp;Get Away With Murder </i>actress had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict diet and undergo rigorous physical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>training</a> to&nbsp;become the powerful General Nanisca. She was at&nbsp;high risk for diabetes, so&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;eat in&nbsp;small portions every 3&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;store energy better. She also trained for at&nbsp;least 5&nbsp;hours per day for 3&nbsp;months. Her routine included running, martial arts, and strength building.</p><p><h2>10. Mark Wahlberg in&nbsp;<i>Father Stu</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/921/f6d/1cc4db5ad3ac013528635770d1.jpg><p>The actor is&nbsp;known for his early morning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>habit</a> of&nbsp;completing a&nbsp;workout by&nbsp;4:00 a.m. every day. But his followers saw a&nbsp;completely different Wahlberg when he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>transformed</a> from a&nbsp;chiseled hunk to&nbsp;having a&nbsp;“dad bod.” As&nbsp;he&nbsp;explained, “I&nbsp;put on&nbsp;30&nbsp;pounds and went from being a&nbsp;guy who was in&nbsp;fighting shape, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;guy who was wheelchair-bound, suffering from a&nbsp;rare muscular degenerative disease.”</p><p>He&nbsp;consumed 11,000 calories per day, which is&nbsp;4-5 times <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>more</a> than what is&nbsp;advised for the average person. He&nbsp;ate even when he&nbsp;was full, and his daily menu included dozens of&nbsp;eggs and bacon, baked potatoes, steak, 2&nbsp;bowls of&nbsp;white rice, and a&nbsp;glass of&nbsp;olive oil. Wahlberg admitted that this unhealthy eating habit eventually took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;him.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have other actors in&nbsp;mind that we&nbsp;can add to&nbsp;this list?
