But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Melanie Gaydos</a> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the uniquely brave individuals who had the guts to&nbsp;defy social standards. The 32-year-old model is&nbsp;not only challenging the fashion industry, but she also highlights the importance of&nbsp;diversity in&nbsp;the beauty world. And as&nbsp;she does just that, Gaydos shared her story, which we&nbsp;believe is&nbsp;worth hearing.</p><p><h2>She was born with a&nbsp;rare genetic condition.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa5/8fb/88d5ff58a6b1cbe8918b2210c9.jpg><p>Melanie Gaydos, 32, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;the east coast but currently lives in&nbsp;Seattle. She was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> with ectodermal dysplasia, a&nbsp;collective term for several extremely rare genetic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conditions</a> affecting skin, hair, and nail growth. She was severely criticized for her appearance when she was younger, but it&nbsp;didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stop</a> her from becoming a&nbsp;well-known model and getting a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;different jobs.</p><h2>“I&nbsp;really don’t like being <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a>&nbsp;I can’t do&nbsp;something.”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8f4/cb7/31b8345c13a70b907b470aac51.jpg><p>Gaydos <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> modeling while attending the Pratt Institute in&nbsp;New York City. She received even more attention after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appearing</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Rammstein music <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>, and offers continued to&nbsp;pour in&nbsp;after that. Her distinctive features are ideal for high fashion and more avant-garde styles. She has, however, rejected being boxed in&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;alternative model and has participated in&nbsp;numerous New York Fashion Week runway events.</p><p><h2>Her fame didn’t come easy.</h2></p><p>The woman we&nbsp;see now wasn’t always made to&nbsp;feel that way growing&nbsp;up. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that in&nbsp;elementary school, she didn’t have any friends. People saw her as&nbsp;strange, frightening, and inhuman. She underwent around 30&nbsp;surgeries as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, which meant she missed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;school due to&nbsp;frequent hospitalization. She is&nbsp;partly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blind</a> today due to&nbsp;her eyelashes curling inward and hurting her corneas.</p><p><h2>She loves and accepts herself the way she&nbsp;is.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ff/e30/64eb1d58728722cc29fb1dbf73.jpg><p>Due to&nbsp;the little bones in&nbsp;her ears, she has hearing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>problems</a>. She has no&nbsp;teeth or&nbsp;hair. She used to&nbsp;wear wigs, but she stopped wearing them in&nbsp;2015, and she also stopped using dentures. Instead, she has decided to&nbsp;accept who she&nbsp;is. “This is&nbsp;the way&nbsp;I was born, and when you are born a&nbsp;certain way, you survive,” she explains.</p><h2>“I&nbsp;was never, ever <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bothered</a> by&nbsp;the way that I&nbsp;look.”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f9/e6c/e25de75eb9939e628fff1f75ad.jpg><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a> her early years, “I&nbsp;didn’t understand why people treated me&nbsp;differently. It’s literally just a&nbsp;disorder of&nbsp;my&nbsp;DNA. It’s just the way my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;born. It&nbsp;hasn’t affected the way&nbsp;I think or&nbsp;anything like that.” But Gaydos believes that things are improving. The definition of&nbsp;beauty in&nbsp;the fashion business and the general public both go&nbsp;beyond “the tall, perfect goddess” image.</p><p><h2>She encourages other women to&nbsp;embrace their beauty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e1/c2e/5022d25b5d9f085d7d4dc967cf.jpg><p>Gaydos must think it’s absurd that other women worry about things like their thigh gaps, their hair curls, or&nbsp;the fatty rolls around their bellies. “Everybody has their own insecurities... It’s really limiting, depressing, to&nbsp;worry about what other people look like and what other people think of&nbsp;us,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “I&nbsp;don’t see why people can’t just be&nbsp;happy with themselves and be&nbsp;happy for other people.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;<a href=# title="beauty standards" data-link=tag>beauty standards</a>?
