This group is mostly men and most likely to be between 25-39.</p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>Attitudes around loyalty schemes: </span></strong><span data-contrast=auto>Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this group is tremendously receptive to loyalty </span>programmes. They are significantly more likely to recommend brands when they are loyalty members (55% agree vs. 33% of the British public in general); they are more loyal to brands when they are members (61% vs. 40%); and feel more emotionally connected to brands when they’s part of a loyalty scheme (50% vs. 29%).</p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>What loyalty </span>programmes do they subscribe to?</strong><span data-contrast=auto> Like the general public, a large portion of this group</span> are members of loyalty programmes with supermarkets (52%), retail stores (31%) and pharmacies (25%). They are, however, more likely than the general population to be enrolled in loyalty schemes with their mobile network provider (9% vs. 6% of the British public in general) and their bank (6% vs. 4%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Like the general public, most regular </span>cinema-goers who aren’t part of a points programme say they do enroll in other schemes to benefit from discounts and offers (56%). But a deeper dive into YouGov data shows they’re notably more likely be motivated by free products, services or experiences (30% vs. 24% of the British public in general). They also enjoy the benefit of being the first to know about promotions, discounts or news from a brand (17% vs. 12%), and are twice as likely to feel motivated by a sense of community (4% vs. 2%).</p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>How to speak to </span>this audience: </strong><span data-contrast=auto>TV, online and radio advertising will most likely draw their attention, but of course this group of movie-goers are more likely than the general public to</span> be compelled by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>adverts at the cinema (18% vs. 11%).</span></span></a></p><p><span data-contrast=auto>But beyond that, a look at attitudes arou</span>nd sports, tech, gaming, and travel may also reveal possible partnerships and reward schemes to grow memberships.</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>YouGov data shows this potential market share</span> are dramatically more likely to say they’re “sports mad” (51% vs. 32% of the British public in general). Looking at their relationship with technology, psychographic data shows this group is more interested in trying the latest tech products, services or apps (63% vs. 44%). This group is also five times as likely as the general public to say esports is one of their top interests (5% vs. 1%). Finally, looking at travel data, we see this group is much more likely to be passionate about travelling (69% vs. 52%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>Finally, YouGov data shows that these cinema patrons don’t carry a cinema loyalty card are notably more likely to enjoy horror films (30% vs. 19% of the general public)</span>, animation (35% vs. 25%) and romance (29% vs 21%).</p><p><span data-contrast=auto>This data offers a small glimpse into how cinema rewards </span>programmes can grow in Great Britain, something which may play a crucial role in re-building custom following pandemic restrictions.</p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>Receive monthly topical insights about the Leisure and entertainment industry, straight to your inbox. </span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>Sign up today</span></span></a><span data-contrast=auto>.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span data-contrast=auto>Discover more </span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>leisure and entertainment content</span></span></a><span data-contrast=auto> here</span></strong></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span data-contrast=none><span data-ccp-charstyle=Hyperlink>Want to run your own research?
