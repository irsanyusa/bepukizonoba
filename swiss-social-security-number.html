But in order to benefit from the ​​social security and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">educational</a> benefits Switzerland has to offer its residents, you must have a Swiss social security number. Known as the Alters- und Hinterlassenenversicherungsnummer (AHV) — meaning Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance Number (OASI) — it is an essential piece of documentation to have when living in Switzerland.</p><p>The Swiss AHV number is widely used as a personal identification number (PIN). It is also known as the AVS number (Assurance vieillesse et survivants) in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a> and Italian-speaking regions. If you’re new to the Swiss social security system, here is everything you need to know about the AHV number and the purposes it serves in Switzerland.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-the-AHV-number-used-for-in-Switzerland?>What is the AHV number used for in Switzerland?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swiss social security system</a> assigns a unique identifier, known as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AHV number</a>, to registered individuals. This number is used for old-age and survivors’ insurance, widows’ and orphans’ pensions, disability insurance, and other social security benefits. As noted above, it’s also occasionally used as a personal identification number in other areas of public administrative work.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who holds Swiss citizenship or a Swiss residence permit can receive welfare services in Switzerland, so the AHV number is very important.</p><p>The AHV number consists of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">13 digits</a> and follows a specific format, beginning with the Swiss country code (756) and ending with a unique, randomly generated sequence that remains unchanged throughout a person’s lifetime. You will find it written on your health insurance card or personal insurance certificate. Swiss data protection laws are strict and designed to ensure anonymity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-get-a-Swiss-social-security-number>How to get a Swiss social security number</h2><p>You must be a resident of Switzerland to get an AHV number. Foreign nationals may need to have a work permit or residence permit in order to apply for one. Every person residing in Switzerland is required to take out basic compulsory health insurance.</p><p>When you successfully apply for health insurance, you will receive your AHV number. Your health insurance may be provided by your employer, in which case your employer will also provide an AHV number to you.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Security matters</h2><p>For peace of mind, it is best to understand the services and provisions you are entitled to. The Swiss social security number, the AHV, is an important element of the robust social safety net that is available for each and every resident living and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">working in Switzerland</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Leona-e1679309439969.jpeg><h2>Leona Quigley</h2><p>Leona has her roots in the South of Ireland, where she grew up on her family farm.
