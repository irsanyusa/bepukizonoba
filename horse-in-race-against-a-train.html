He called it . . . Tom Thumb.</p><p>And on this day Cooper accepted a challenge to prove that his mechanical power was greater than horsepower.</p><p>Until this point in time, rail companies in America, such as the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) relied on horses to pull their passenger and freight trains, even though steam locomotives were used elsewhere in the world.</p><p>But that tradition was about to end when B&O directors were given a ride aboard Tom Thumb from Baltimore to Ellicott Mills, Maryland (now Ellicott City). They were amazed that the locomotive could achieve speeds of 10-14 miles per hour.</p><p>Then, according to legend, Tom Thumb took part in a famous race with a horse-drawn car while returning from a trip to Ellicott Mills. The locomotive was well ahead of the horse-drawn car until a mechanical fault caused the engine to lose steam and the horse reached the finishing line first.</p><p>The event is a staple of American folklore though there is no documentation to substantiate it. Nevertheless, B&O were clearly impressed with Tom Thumb and ran this notice in newspapers:</p><p>The Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Company being desirous of obtaining a supply of locomotive steam engines of American manufacture, adapted to their road, have given public notice that they will pay the sum of Four Thousand Dollars (equivalent to $136,000 in 2022 dollars) for the most approved engine which shall be delivered for trial upon the road on or before the <a href=#>first of June, 1831</a>.</p><p>Although Tom Thumb is known as the first successful American steam locomotive, hauling passengers until at least&nbsp;<a href=#>March 1831</a>, it&nbsp;was never put into regular service.</p><p>But a replica was built in 1927 for the B&O Railroad Museum and still runs today. The locomotive appeared on a US postage stamp in 1952.</p><p><b>Published:</b> <i>August 15, 2022</i><br><b>Updated:</b> <i>August 17, 2022</i></p><br><h2>Related Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/locomotion-sml.jpg alt="Fear as First Passenger Train Reaches 15mph" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Fear as First Passenger Train Reaches 15mph</h3><span class=linked_text>The steam engine Locomotion No. 1 took passengers for a ride on this day – the first in the world to do so and, for at least one person, at frightening speed.</span><span class=linked_date>September 27, 1825</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/golden-spike.jpg alt="The Golden Spike" width=270 height=205 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Golden Spike</h3><span class=linked_text>The 1st Transcontinental Railroad is finished at last!</span><span class=linked_date>May 10, 1869</span></a></li></ul><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Articles on Events in August</h2></a><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/peggy-guggenheim-sml.jpg alt="Lady With Twin Passions: Art And Men" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Lady With Twin Passions: Art And Men</h3><span class=linked_text>American art collector extraordinaire and socialite Peggy Guggenheim, born on this day, was heiress to the family fortune and a highly colourful figure.</span><span class=linked_date>August 26, 1898</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/eruption-2018-sml.jpg alt="Krakatoa: The World’s Mightiest Explosion" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Krakatoa: The World’s Mightiest Explosion</h3><span class=linked_text>The world’s biggest-ever explosion – 13,000 times greater than the Hiroshima bomb – happened on this day as eruptions of the Krakatoa volcano reached a climax</span><span class=linked_date>August 27, 1883</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/children-sml.jpg alt="Fighting The Scourge of Child Labour" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Fighting The Scourge of Child Labour</h3><span class=linked_text>Britain’s first Factory Act came into law on this day.
