Whether it’s escaping predators or&nbsp;courting a&nbsp;female, some animals have developed such extraordinary bodies and adaptations over time that they could make any plastic surgeon jealous.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have asked Mother Nature to&nbsp;show&nbsp;us some of&nbsp;her most transformative animals and here is&nbsp;the result.</p><p><h2>1. The Bird-of Paradise has a&nbsp;complex mating dance in&nbsp;which the male courts the female.</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>bird-of-paradise</a> belongs to&nbsp;the family Paradisaeidae. This family is&nbsp;best known for the gaudy plumage of&nbsp;the males. Most species have elaborate mating rituals, in&nbsp;particular the Paradisaea species uses a&nbsp;highly ritualized dance, as&nbsp;you can see in&nbsp;the photo.</p><p><h2>2. The Chlamydosaurus deploys the large frill around its neck for fear, courtship, and intimidation.</h2></p><p>Known as&nbsp;the <a href=#>frilled-necked lizard</a>, this lizard is&nbsp;characterized by&nbsp;a&nbsp;crown of&nbsp;mobile skin around its neck. When the lizard is&nbsp;frightened, it&nbsp;opens its mouth, thus widening the crown of&nbsp;skin of&nbsp;the neck. This reaction is&nbsp;used for territorial issues, to&nbsp;discourage predators, and during courtship.</p><p><h2>3. The Flower Crab spider changes color to&nbsp;resemble the flower’s surface where they sit.</h2></p><p>Spiders called <a href=#>flower crab spiders</a> can change their color. Their name also refers to&nbsp;their uncanny resemblance to&nbsp;crabs in&nbsp;the way these spiders hold their 2&nbsp;front pairs of&nbsp;legs, and their ability to&nbsp;walk sideways or&nbsp;backward. They usually change color to&nbsp;resemble the flower surface on&nbsp;which they sit in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;hide from their prey.</p><p><h2>4. The Stick insect replicates the look of&nbsp;sticks and leaves to&nbsp;disguise itself better.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54c/c8b/50ed57544ea2c07e7d1cfbd267.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01a/6d4/1c94ac56c1886e8cd23b066082.jpg><p>The Phasmatodea are more commonly known as&nbsp;<a href=#>stick insects</a>. They use mimicry as&nbsp;a&nbsp;defense mechanism, replicating the appearance of&nbsp;sticks and leaves. Their immobility and their ability to&nbsp;change color with their surrounding environment represent a&nbsp;bonus that helps them to&nbsp;better blend into their surrounding environment.</p><p><h2>5. The Orchid mantis is&nbsp;characterized by&nbsp;a&nbsp;structure adapted for camouflage, mimicking parts of&nbsp;the orchid flower.</h2></p><p>Known as&nbsp;the flower mantis and pink orchid mantis, this insect comes from the tropical forests of&nbsp;Southeast Asia. The <a href=#>orchid mantis</a> is&nbsp;characterized by&nbsp;its bright color and a&nbsp;mimetic structure that simulates parts of&nbsp;the orchid flower. Its 4&nbsp;walking legs look like flower petals.</p><p><h2>6. The Common baron (caterpillar) evolved its shape to&nbsp;avoid predators.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/785/851/2093765b30ad45b6473c6b2312.jpg><p>A&nbsp;native of&nbsp;Sri Lanka, India, and Southeast Asia, the common baron is&nbsp;a&nbsp;butterfly. A&nbsp;single <a href=#>Baron caterpillar</a> hatches from underneath a&nbsp;leaf, as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;the specialized area where a&nbsp;female Baron lays its egg. Baron caterpillars evolved their shape to&nbsp;avoid predators. This improves their odds of&nbsp;surviving, becoming a&nbsp;butterfly, and reproducing.</p><p><h2>7. The Pygmy seahorse changes its skin color to&nbsp;camouflage, frighten predators, communicate their emotions, and for courtship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/737/9b5/3347f95248a6cb48c765d24f7b.jpg><p><a href=#>Seahorses</a> are marine animals that are able to&nbsp;change color. There are many reasons for wanting to&nbsp;change skin color: disguise, to&nbsp;frighten predators, to&nbsp;communicate their emotions, and courtship. It’s very difficult to&nbsp;distinguish seahorses from sea algae, soft corals, or&nbsp;sea fans where they usually live.</p><p><h2>8. The Horned desert viper can burrow quickly into the sand, and its color helps it&nbsp;camouflage itself to&nbsp;hunt for prey.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/211/b1c/6529cb5df0ad4106699dbdabb5.jpg><p>The <a href=#>horned desert viper</a> can burrow quickly into the sand by&nbsp;making rapid sideways movements with its body, leaving only its head and eyes visible. The color of&nbsp;the snake helps to&nbsp;camouflage it&nbsp;against sand or&nbsp;rocky ground, especially when it&nbsp;is&nbsp;partially buried.</p><p><h2>9. The Chotacabras pauraque have mysterious appearance that helps them blend perfectly into their habitat.</h2></p><p>Because of&nbsp;their strange appearance, these birds blend perfectly into their habitat and are very difficult to&nbsp;detect during the day when they are usually hidden while sleeping. The <a href=#>Pauraque</a> benefits from its camouflage plumage that blends well with the color of&nbsp;the undergrowth and disappears, flatting against the ground as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>10. The Spiny Leaf Insect adopts a&nbsp;curved pose when it&nbsp;hangs inverted in&nbsp;foliage, and it&nbsp;can change its color.</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>leaf insect</a> uses passive and active mimicry, adopting a&nbsp;curved pose while hanging upside down in&nbsp;foliage. It&nbsp;can vary in&nbsp;color and be&nbsp;brown, green, cream, yellowish, reddish, or&nbsp;completely white. Like stick insects, it&nbsp;actively sways back and forth or&nbsp;sideways when it&nbsp;is&nbsp;disturbed or&nbsp;when there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gust of&nbsp;wind, this is&nbsp;done to&nbsp;look like it’s one of&nbsp;the leaves, rustling in&nbsp;the wind.</p><p><h2>11. The Uroplatus gecko has developed a&nbsp;flap of&nbsp;skin that makes them practically invisible.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f9/c3e/e2f519511fafa627cffdb63bc9.png><p>All species of&nbsp;<a href=#>geckos</a> have highly developed mimetic coloring. Most are brown-gray, black, or&nbsp;greenish brown with skin that resembles tree bark. We&nbsp;have 2&nbsp;variants through which these geckos are camouflaged: the leaf shape and the bark shape. Some have developed a&nbsp;flap of&nbsp;skin along their body, known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“dermal flap.” When they lie down against the trees during the day, it&nbsp;casts shadows and makes their outline practically invisible.</p><p><h2>12. The Stone fish simulates the color of&nbsp;coral and surrounding stones to&nbsp;camouflage itself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/553/be6/943f63503f943934fc57e0c9e9.jpeg><p>The <a href=#>Stonefish</a> is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Synanceiidae family. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;dangerously poisonous and even deadly for humans. The name of&nbsp;the species, the stone fish, derives from its gray and mottled camouflage similar to&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stone. Swimmers may not notice them and inadvertently step on&nbsp;them, thus coming to&nbsp;a&nbsp;deadly end.</p><p><h2>13. The Malayan horned frog can disguise itself among the foliage thanks to&nbsp;its brown color and its particular morphology.</h2></p><p>The long-nosed horned frog, also known as&nbsp;the <a href=#>Malayan horned frog </a>or&nbsp;Malayan leaf frog, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;species of&nbsp;frog restricted to&nbsp;the rainforest areas of&nbsp;South East Asia. They are light to&nbsp;dark brown on&nbsp;their dorsal surface with varying patterns and camouflage very well with the forest floor.</p><p><h2>14. Flying fish have special lateral extensions that allow them to&nbsp;glide over the water.</h2></p><p>Numerous morphological characteristics give the <a href=#>flying fish</a> its ability to&nbsp;glide over the surface of&nbsp;the ocean. Its rigid body gives the flying fish aerodynamic advantages, increasing its speed, and improving its performance. The fish is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;increase its time spent flying by&nbsp;staying straight or&nbsp;taking advantage of&nbsp;the updrafts, created by&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;aerial and oceanic currents.</p><p><h2>15. The bird dropping spider mimics bird droppings to&nbsp;avoid predators.</h2></p><p>Celaenia excavata, the <a href=#>bird dropping spider</a>, derives its name from mimicking bird droppings to&nbsp;avoid predators which are comprised of&nbsp;mainly birds. They can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;Australia, usually along the eastern and southern coasts.</p><p><h2>16. Scorpion fish use their bright colors to&nbsp;blend into the reef and catch their prey.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81d/2e8/2914f0578d9da11e1a47094b93.jpg><p><a href=#>Scorpaenidae</a> (also known as&nbsp;scorpion fish) are a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;mostly marine fish that include many of&nbsp;the world’s most venomous species. These animals have bright colors that help them blend into the reef.</p><p><h2>17. The Arctic Fox can change its white coat to&nbsp;brown.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;winter, <a href=#>Arctic foxes</a> have beautiful white coats, which allow them to&nbsp;blend in&nbsp;with the snow of&nbsp;the Arctic tundra. This allows arctic foxes to&nbsp;effectively capture prey such as&nbsp;hares and fish. In&nbsp;summer their color changes to&nbsp;brown. This change provides an&nbsp;excellent camouflage against the rocks of&nbsp;the Arctic tundra during that season.</p><p><h2>18. The Golden tortoise beetle changes color as&nbsp;an&nbsp;optical illusion.</h2></p><p>The <a href=#>golden tortoise beetle</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;insect that can change color. They change color due to&nbsp;particular events like meeting a&nbsp;mate and being touched by&nbsp;a&nbsp;human being. When mating or&nbsp;shaking, tortoise beetles change their color from gold to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright red. The color change occurs due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;optical illusion.</p><p><h2>19. The Myrmarachne imitate an&nbsp;ant by&nbsp;waving their front legs in&nbsp;the air to&nbsp;simulate antennae.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5c/4bd/f0d00c55f2b1bd0c27be8525b2.jpg><p><a href=#>Myrmarachne</a> are usually found in&nbsp;the tropics from Africa to&nbsp;Australia, with some species found in&nbsp;the New World. Myrmarachne are jumping spiders that imitate ants by&nbsp;putting their front legs in&nbsp;the air to&nbsp;simulate antennae. Some species also look very much like ants.</p><p>Did you already know about any of&nbsp;these animals? Which of&nbsp;them do&nbsp;you find most extraordinary?
