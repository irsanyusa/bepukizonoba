But as "Big Bang" truly does near its finale, some of their more recent posts have been a bit more somber.</p><p>On Wednesday, Melissa Rauch, who plays Bernadette, posted the following photo.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"About to go into our table read for the series finale written by this group of geniuses," Rauch wrote in the caption. "People often ask what the secret is behind the success of the show ... well, it's no secret ... it's the sheer brilliance of these incredible minds. Love them all so very much."</p><p>Rauch later posted the following photo as well, of the whole cast hugging it out.</p><p>"Just because I haven't flooded my face with enough tears during/after today's final <a href=# id=b75cb272-e9ea-3249-a6e7-40eb000bfe22>@bigbangtheory_cbs</a> table read," she wrote, "here's a pic of our pre-show huddle last night."</p><p>Mayim Bialik, who plays Amy on the show, posted the following picture with Rauch.</p><p>"This lady and I have been through a lot together as the new kids on the block of season 3 of <a href=# id=9fe16d85-a5c5-3390-a0fd-9b725489b87c>@bigbangtheory_cbs,</a> " Bialik wrote, "We have cried together and laughed together and raised kids on a set together. I couldn't have made it without her with any semblance of sanity."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Cast member Kunal Nayyar, who plays Raj, kept it simple, captioning the below photo, "Just read the final episode ... Gnite."</p><p>Perhaps most heartbreaking of all was cast member Kaley Cuoco's Instagram post. Cuoco plays Penny on the show.</p><p>"Post table read for <a href=# id=b75cb272-e9ea-3249-a6e7-40eb000bfe22>@bigbangtheory_cbs</a> finale episode," Cuoco wrote on an image of her crying and hugging her last TBBT script.</p><p>After 12 years with them, we'll probably miss this cast of characters just as much as they will.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme9OhnGaamZx6o63NoGStoJWkv7p5wpqqrWWZqHqxu9KtoKefXaW2pMDUq5ysZZ%2BberW0xKKpZqSRqMFusdWeqWaskZe5pnnRnpidZZGjsW6106xmo66iZbKvtg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
