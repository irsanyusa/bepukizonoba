It is also notoriously known for being the hardest karaoke song to sing in front of your friends. The notes are seriously so high. Jimmy Fallon enlisted a roster of celebrities to cover the tune with Clarkson during The Tonight Show in 2019.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-other-celebrities-hit-the-high-notes-in-kelly-clarkson-s-since-u-been-gone>Can Other Celebrities Hit the High Notes in Kelly Clarkson’s ‘Since U Been Gone’?</h2><p>Clarkson, Fallon, Shaquille O’Neal, John Oliver, Rachel Brosnahan, Mumford & Sons, Meghan Trainor, Anthony Anderson, and The Roots all performed vocal gymnastics during the song. Clarkson started off singing in her signature lower register. O’Neal licked his lips as he took a stab at the second line. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was a rapper back in the day</a> but is not so much of a singer now.</p><p>Fallon strummed an air guitar and we didn’t expect anything less from the very animated host. The highlight of the song was Oliver singing “yes, yes” instead of “yeah, yeah.” Trainor really brought it home with her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible vocal abilities</a>. Since this video was posted, fans have been asking her to release a full cover of “Since U Been Gone.”</p><p>Oliver starting screaming during the hook. Those high notes are no joke. Anderson’s version of singing basically sounded more like motivational speaking. Everyone launched into air guitar solos. The members of Mumford & Sons threw in some awkward dance moves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This impromptu music video resembles a scene from the 2012 movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pitch Perfect</a> where those trying out for a capella groups must sing “Since U Been Gone.” Just as you imagined, the high notes in the hook proved to be quite the challenge for the singers. Only Ben Platt and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ester Dean</a> were able to nail the song perfectly.</p><p>Clarkson’s Grammy for “Since U Been Gone” is obviously very well deserved. The American Idol winner is constantly pushing herself vocally. She even hits some unreal notes in her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kellyoke covers</a> on The Kelly Clarkson Show. She is one of the best singers in the music world without question.</p><p>Which celebrity do you think nailed the song the best?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NUP_193644_5871.jpeg alt="Why Do Choir Groups Always Receive a Golden Buzzer on ‘AGT’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlmp66rsWMn5ilpJ%2Bjeq670Z5krKGenHq0tc2cnGatXZeyprqMoKannV2eu260yKWYq6GfqsBuwsidnKhn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
