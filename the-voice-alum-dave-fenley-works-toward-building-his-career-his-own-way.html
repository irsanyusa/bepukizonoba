The country crooner was the one to beat as contestants moved into the Top 10. Dave chose to join Team Blake over Team Kelly and he was able to retain his spot through both the Battle and Knockout Rounds. The singer’s smooth voice has won him fans across the country.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dave-was-a-child-prodigy>Dave Was a Child Prodigy</h2><p>The singer is from a small town in Lufkin, Texas, but his family moved to Canada while he was in high school. Both places had a strong influence on his passion for music. Dave grew up listening to country music. He showed an ability to learn melodies and lyrics at a young age. As a child, Dave joined his Southern Baptist church with his father. In Canada the singer learned to appreciate soul music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dave Is a Self-Taught Musician</h2><p>The Voice alum has been singing for most of his life but he didn’t begin creating music of his own until he was a teenager. Dave taught himself how to write songs at 15 years old and how to play the guitar at 18. He would often play at bars, even before he was of legal drinking age. Dave dropped out of college to pursue his music ambitions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dave Was on ‘America’s Got Talent’</h2><p>Before gracing The Voice with his talent, Dave was a contestant on Season 8 of America’s Got Talent. For his audition the singer performed an acoustic version of “Too Close.” The audience gave the singer a standing ovation. Dave received four yeses from the judges. The singer was a frontrunner throughout his season. Dave shocked viewers and the judges when he chose to put his own spin to the Spice Girls hit song “Say You’ll Be There.” His soulful rendition earned him rave reviews, but he was sent home after the semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/E5kHBRwv6UM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Shelton Connection before ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Before Dave joined Season 15 of The Voice he was on tour with Shelton’s wife at the time, Miranda Lambert. The singer was discovered by Shelton and Lambert while he was performing for Whiskey Jam at Winner’s Bar in Nashville. Dave joined the tour in 2013. Unfortunately, Shelton seemed as though he did not recognize the singer when he auditioned for the singing competition show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>On ‘The Voice’</h2><p>Of course Dave was on Team Blake. His performances often received standing ovations from the audience. Shelton was sure that the singer would make it further in the competition. Although he was eliminated in the Top 8 Dave gained fans across the country.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Life After Talent Competition Shows</h2><p>With America’s Got Talent and The Voice behind him, Dave has still walked away a winner. The singer is one of the more popular contestants from both shows who has consistently put out new music. The songwriter has released his Dave Fenley Christmas EP as well as singles such as “Welcome to the South.” Fans of Dave have watched him release cover songs such as Lady Gaga’s “Shallow.” He also continues to do <a href=#>live shows</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/163200_7383-1-e1651259432761.jpg alt="Meet 16-Year-Old Emyrson Flora, ‘American Idol’s Youngest Competitor" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecClrKZllJbDpnnFnqWlnalixLC%2Byqxkraenlr%2BlecGuoKWcmaO0brTIrGScmaKasrN5x6KqZqeno3q4rdho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
