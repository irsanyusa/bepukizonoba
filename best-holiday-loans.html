We included 8 lenders that offer personal loans you can use at the holidays.</p><p>Please keep in mind that interest rates, terms, minimum eligibility requirements, and other specifics are subject to change at any time and that borrowers with higher credit scores and other markers of creditworthiness are more likely to qualify for lower interest rates. Not all borrowers will qualify for the rates listed.</p><h2 id=how-to-select-the-best-holiday-loan>How to select the best holiday loan</h2><p>There are several factors to consider when applying for a holiday loan. First, the best holiday loans aren’t always the ones with the lowest interest rates—or those marketed as holiday or special occasion loans. Rate is important, but other factors, such as loan term and origination fees, can also have an impact. And choose a lender that doesn’t charge an early repayment penalty. This way, you have the option to save even more money by paying off the loan early.</p><p>Always check to make sure that you meet the lender’s minimum income and credit score requirements before you apply, to improve your chances of qualifying. Finally, choose a lender with a solid customer service reputation. It can make a big difference if and when you need help down the road.</p><h2 id=average-holiday-loan-rates>Average holiday loan rates</h2><p>According to our research, the average personal loan rate hovers between 8.66% and 30.94%—rates we calculated by averaging the low and high end of the interest rates for the 10 lenders we analyzed.</p><p>Remember that the higher your credit score, the lower the interest rate you’re likely to qualify for.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-apply-for-a-holiday-loan>How do I apply for a holiday loan?</h2><p>These days, most personal loan applications, including holiday loans, can be completed online. With most lenders, you can prequalify by providing basic information including your name, address, and Social Security number—which the bank may use to perform a <a rel=alternate href=#>soft credit pull</a> to estimate your interest rate. (Prequalifying doesn’t usually affect your credit score.)</p><p>To finish your application, you’ll need to provide the following documentation to confirm your identity, income, and other demographic information:</p><ul><li>Government-issued photo ID.</li><li>Proof of residence.</li><li>Pay stubs, bank statements, or tax returns.</li></ul><p>Nowadays, most of these documents can be uploaded to your lender online. Once your application is reviewed and approved, you’ll receive your funds—usually within five to seven business days, but with some lenders in as little as 24 hours.</p><h2 id=alternatives-to-holiday-loans>Alternatives to holiday loans</h2><p>While you may be tempted to take out a holiday loan, doing so can have serious financial ramifications over the long term—for a temporary payoff. Here are some holiday loan alternatives to consider before you submit your application.</p><h2 id=more-about-holiday-loans>More about holiday loans</h2><p>Still have questions about holiday loans? We’ve got your back.</p><h3>What is a holiday loan?</h3><p>A holiday loan is just a personal loan used to cover holiday expenses. Like any other personal loan, it’s unsecured debt—meaning there’s no collateral that the bank can use to lower its risk. This is why personal loans have higher interest rates than a <a rel=alternate href=#>secured loan</a>, like a <a rel=alternate href=#>second&nbsp; mortgage</a> or new car loan.</p><p>As with any other personal loan, the balance is repaid in monthly or bi-weekly installments over a period of time, known as the loan term. Payments include both principal—the money you borrowed—as well as interest—the money the bank charges for the service of providing the loan.</p><h3>What can a holiday loan be used for?</h3><p>Personal loans, including holiday loans, can be used for just about any purpose you can imagine. Besides party expenses and gifts, people will take out personal loans to cover unexpected medical expenses, vacations, and more. Check with your lender directly to ensure it doesn’t have any limitations or restrictions around how the money can be spent.</p><h3>Where to get a holiday loan</h3><p>You can get holiday loans from a variety of different lending institutions—and these days, thanks to the advent of online banking, they’re easier to access than ever.</p><h4>Banks</h4><p>Most large banks offer personal loans, which you can use for holiday expenses. In fact, you may be eligible for favorable loan terms if you’re an existing bank customer.</p><h4>Credit unions</h4><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Credit unions</a> also offer personal loan products, including holiday loans. If you already have a checking or savings account with the credit union, you may qualify for rate discounts and other incentives.</p><h4>Online lenders</h4><p>As you can see from our list above, many online lenders offer personal loans that you can use to cover holiday expenses. While many online lenders are legitimate, given the prevalence of online scams, you should always research the company you’re dealing with before you borrow any money.</p><h3>Tips to manage a holiday loan</h3><p>Taking out a holiday loan can have a negative impact on your financial situation—but if you follow the proper steps, it doesn’t have to be a detriment.</p><ul><li>Budget for your loan ahead of time. Having a set payment each month helps you understand how much extra wiggle room you’ll need in your budget to pay back your loan—which means avoiding potential sticker shock and missed payments. Figure out what you can afford beforehand by using a <a rel=alternate href=#>loan calculator</a>.</li><li>Always pay on time. Late or insufficient payments are reported to the credit bureaus and can negatively affect your credit score. Make sure you make your payment in full and on time each month.</li><li>Pay extra when you can. By making additional, lump sum payments to the principal balance of your loan, you can save interest and pay the loan off faster. Just make sure your lender doesn’t charge any early repayment penalties.</li></ul><h2 id=time-stamp-holiday-loans-arent-the-only-way-to-enjoy-the-season>TIME Stamp: Holiday loans aren’t the only way to enjoy the season</h2><p>Holiday loans can help you pay for presents, parties, and more—but they’re still a form of debt, and higher-interest debt at that. While choosing the right lender can lower the long-term financial impact of a holiday loan, those hoping to end up on Santa’s “nice” list, financially speaking, might want to look for another option.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are holiday loans a good idea?</h3><p>While any kind of loan can have a negative impact on a person’s financial health, borrowing money to cover a short-term expense, like a holiday party, may not be worth years of monthly payments.</p><h3>What credit score do you need for a holiday loan?</h3><p>Each lender has its own standards when it comes to qualifying borrowers for a holiday loan—or any kind of loan, for that matter. Some lenders have minimum credit score requirements as low as 300, while others set higher minimums, like 680. (In most cases, borrowers with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates.)</p><h3>How hard is it to get a holiday loan?</h3><p>Like any other loan or line of credit, holiday loans are approved based on the applicant’s financial standing, including factors like credit score, current debt, income, cash flow, and more. Because holiday loans are considered unsecured debt, the bank doesn’t have collateral to fall back on—which means these loans can be slightly harder to get than a secured loan like an <a rel=alternate href=#>auto loan</a> or mortgage.</p><h3>How do I prequalify for a holiday loan?</h3><p>To prequalify for a holiday loan, you’ll need to provide your basic demographic information to a lender. The prequalification process will estimate your interest rate and usually entails a soft credit pull, which shouldn’t impact your credit score. However, most lenders will require a hard credit pull before officially approving your application.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8o7HSrWShp5yesaLFjKWmmqajZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
