Sometimes, one of&nbsp;those has a&nbsp;similar age to&nbsp;us. Actually, for many people, this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;important factor, but for others, it’s really not a&nbsp;thing at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The latter is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Catherine Zeta-Jones" data-link=tag>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a> and <a href=# title="Michael Douglas" data-link=tag>Michael Douglas</a>. Age never mattered to&nbsp;them. Douglas is&nbsp;about 25&nbsp;years older than his wife, and to&nbsp;this day, they’re one of&nbsp;the most stable couples in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.</p><p>Despite prejudice in&nbsp;Hollywood, their love story is&nbsp;still going strong 20&nbsp;years after it&nbsp;started, and <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;tell you how they became the best example of&nbsp;why a&nbsp;large age difference can’t stop love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffb/cb2/fd5b725d5193135cce1124a6a8.jpg><p>Catherine Zeta-Jones was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;September&nbsp;25, 1969, and began her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> when she was just 15&nbsp;years old. She became popular in&nbsp;her home country, the United Kingdom, in&nbsp;1990, on&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show <i>The Darling Buds of&nbsp;May</i>. But the world came to&nbsp;know her name in&nbsp;1998 after her role in&nbsp;<i>The Mask of&nbsp;Zorro</i> alongside Antonio Banderas. The success of&nbsp;that film not only gave her instant fame but at&nbsp;an&nbsp;event where she was promoting the film, she met the man who would become the love of&nbsp;her life, actor Michael Douglas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/167/a4a/2d18b550099a0dcebcb0ee0753.jpg><p>Interestingly, he&nbsp;was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>born</a> on&nbsp;September&nbsp;25, but 25&nbsp;years earlier. As&nbsp;the son of&nbsp;the popular actor, Kirk Douglas, he&nbsp;spent his childhood between film sets when he&nbsp;visited his father during his vacations. He&nbsp;lived with his mother, as&nbsp;his parents were divorced. Following in&nbsp;his father’s footsteps, he&nbsp;began to&nbsp;love movies and chose acting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;profession, despite his father’s refusal. He&nbsp;debuted in&nbsp;1966, and years later created his own film production company, Big Stick Productions.</p><p>In&nbsp;1997, the life of&nbsp;the actress took a&nbsp;turn. She moved to&nbsp;the United States to&nbsp;immerse herself in&nbsp;Hollywood and, after many auditions, landed the role of&nbsp;Elena in&nbsp;the masked swordsman movie.</p><p>Not only did she reach new heights professionally, but her future husband was just around the corner. Douglas, who was already a&nbsp;heavyweight in&nbsp;the industry, wanted to&nbsp;meet her after seeing her in&nbsp;that film, although she thought it&nbsp;was for work purposes: “I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;film festival. I&nbsp;thought Michael Douglas wanted to&nbsp;meet me&nbsp;for work because&nbsp;I knew he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;producer as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. I&nbsp;genuinely thought that because&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;work mode and&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;film festival, and that’s where film deals are made. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;never thought, ’Oh my&nbsp;God, he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;date me.’ [...] And within hours of&nbsp;meeting&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;father my&nbsp;children. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;presumed this was not for a&nbsp;job.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/afe/88c/e616965f63a9f8fb204387c2c6.jpg><p>Although she was not too convinced by&nbsp;his proposal, Douglas insisted and they become friends over the phone, as&nbsp;their busy schedules did not allow them to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the same cities. However, the friendship was strong and later developed into a&nbsp;romantic relationship.</p><p>They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> “I&nbsp;do” in&nbsp;November 2000, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;grand wedding at&nbsp;the Plaza Hotel in&nbsp;New York, where they not only celebrated and sealed their love forever but also started their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, as&nbsp;3&nbsp;months earlier she had given birth to&nbsp;their first child, Dylan. The little boy joined the family made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them and Cameron, the actor’s eldest son from a&nbsp;previous <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. Years later, in&nbsp;2003, the family portrait was completed with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>arrival</a> of&nbsp;their second daughter, Carys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abb/c05/ddc5ec59a3841e1e696de8e968.jpg><p>But in&nbsp;the best love stories, there always comes a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;conflict, and unfortunately, this is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception. Their happiness was interrupted when, in&nbsp;2010, the actor was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diagnosed</a> with throat cancer. Fortunately, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;beat&nbsp;it. Zeta-Jones was shaken from Douglas’ condition and was struggling with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mental health</a>. Later, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which she chose to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hospitalized for some time.</p><p>Those turbulent years were challenging for both of&nbsp;them, so&nbsp;they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;spend some time apart to&nbsp;evaluate things and work on&nbsp;their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eea/f4a/192afd540eaad6af25b1362d14.jpg><p>But love can overcome any obstacle, and their separation was just a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;make them stronger: “It&nbsp;took work on&nbsp;both our parts,” Douglas <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;don’t think there’s much chance of&nbsp;fixing a&nbsp;relationship if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;you is&nbsp;already out the door. I&nbsp;think we’re both mellower and wiser”. He&nbsp;also said that they are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very open relationship and that transparency is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very important factor for their family. “We&nbsp;share everything around the table [...]. I&nbsp;think that way you clear the air and everyone knows what’s going&nbsp;on,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Maybe that’s one of&nbsp;the secrets to&nbsp;keeping the relationship and the family going, with children that are now young adults, and the eldest already providing them with 2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grandchildren</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0bb/6f7/17eed85c2aa981c17f34bed4bc.jpg><p>Last year, they celebrated 20&nbsp;years together, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that the older she gets, the more similar they become, as&nbsp;she feels the 25-year gap between them is&nbsp;getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>Even though they are 2&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half decades apart, that was never a&nbsp;problem: “Historically, older men and younger women have been together. But suddenly you get to&nbsp;a&nbsp;generation where it&nbsp;becomes strange. When my&nbsp;mother talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;about men and things in&nbsp;life, she never really emphasized age. And it’s so&nbsp;funny because Michael and my&nbsp;parents are the same age, and when they see&nbsp;us together, they don’t even question that there’s a&nbsp;25-year difference,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. She also added that her husband never made her feel that disparity separates them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b4/4ce/29f2f457dda61b8da66267f146.jpg><p>Their Instagram accounts are responsible for showing&nbsp;us their wonderful relationship through the things and events they dedicate to&nbsp;each other, such as&nbsp;their shared birthday, special dates, and important events in&nbsp;their lives. Their family continues to&nbsp;grow and their love is&nbsp;as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the beginning, serving as&nbsp;a&nbsp;faithful example that after the worst storms the sun always comes out, and that age is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;number when there is&nbsp;affection and understanding in&nbsp;between.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the biggest challenge for a&nbsp;couple that has an&nbsp;age gap? What are the characteristics that your ideal partner should have, even if&nbsp;they’re older or&nbsp;younger than you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYysq6iqqWK8p3nCmquhnaKeu6Z52Z6rmmWapLumv4yapZ1lnZ6wqa3EpWSdp6WcuaK%2FjK2fmqxdpb%2BwwsSsZKWnppp6qa3SZqWoZZGcsm6Ej2xvcW1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
