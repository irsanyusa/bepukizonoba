The British commentator lavished praise on both but ultimately settled on <a href=#>Messi</a> as his pick.</p>"While both are brilliant, they are actually quite different. Ronaldo’s capacity for leaping and scoring with his head is phenomenal. He is brilliant, but if you asked me who I would want to watch if I had to watch one or the other every day for the rest of my life, I’d pick Messi," he said in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nana Aba</a>.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/d5ecab45ca0287ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"Messi is Not Perfect": Hearts of Oak Coach Aboubakar Ouattara Claims</span></p></a><h2>Why Drury picked Messi</h2><p class=align-left>The legendary icon then went ahead to give an in-depth analysis of why he prefers the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">2022 World Cup winner</a>.</p><p></p>"He appears to do what is impossible. He plays off his left foot. He almost doesn’t need a right foot – mind you, he can score perfectly well with his right foot – but he weaves through spaces that don’t exist. He’s like a slippery eel. They can’t get hold of him. He sort of defies physics."<h2>Jay Jay Okocha 'settled' GOAT debate</h2><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> had also earlier reported on Jay <a href=#>Jay Okocha's pick for the GOAT debate</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The retired <a href=#>Super Eagles</a> forward picked Messi, noting that his talent comes naturally.</p><p class=align-left>The two players have since left European football, with Messi heading to the United States and <a href=#>Ronaldo</a> playing in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkwLG70a2qaJ6fpMGjrculZmpuYGmEdYWMppysq5lisLO10q2gmqafYr%2BwusClm6hlk6S6rrHNrZitp6JivabAxKtknaqlp8Zur8eoqp5loKGuurHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
