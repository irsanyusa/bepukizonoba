A spokesman says it was done automatically, and not deliberately. By mid-morning, access to Battleland from corps computers had been restored, Lieut. Colonel Stew Upton said Monday morning.</p><p>He says he knows the “<a href=#>What’s Wrong with the Marines Corps?</a>” post didn’t trigger the denial of access – as a Marine reader <a href=#>suggested</a> — because Upton couldn’t access it from his work computer a week ago after it came to his attention.</p><p><span id=more-66977></span>His theory: both Battleland and CNN’s Security Clearance “have the name `blog’ in your script for your website address.” That, he suggests, acted as an automatic trigger to deny access (although it doesn’t explain why access had been allowed for nearly a year before).</p><p>“That’s how we knew it was blocked before,” he adds. “We had to have that post – `What’s Wrong With the Marine Corps’ – sent to us from outside the network, so it was blocked before that – that’s how we know that.”</p><p>Upton says that “there’s a number of red flags that go up all the time with the network – <a href=#>Drudge’s</a> site can become blocked at times because maybe its pushing folks over to Chinese media – Xinhua – and stuff like that. It’s the network protecting itself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkam2sLqNraCmnV6YvK57kWloa2dgZ3xzfI6mmKuhnpp6pLvRqapmmpGpwa2xy5qlnWWTqsGwssVmmGarnpaztns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
