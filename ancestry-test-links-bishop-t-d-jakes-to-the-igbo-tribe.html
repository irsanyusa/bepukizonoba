It was me, it was Oprah Winfrey. It was Quincy Jones and others,” Jakes told <strong>BBC Igbo</strong>.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8bcf7076-1d6d-4702-9331-5441a0144765 data-caption="Bishop T.D.

My ancestors were Igbos. It’s indescribable. It gives something that we the African-Americans don’t have, which is roots.”</p><p>The 63-year-old says he’s delighted with the result as he found several similar traits of Igbos in him.</p><p>“It gave me an understanding of my roots. It was interesting to see how similar my personality is to how Igbo people are described. They’re described as hardworking, industrious and innovative,” he also said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“They have strong business acumen. I deeply relate to that. It explained to me; it’s odd that I was never born there, yet, see so many traces. I’ve always had strong business acumen.</p><p>“I’ve been aggressive in business. Although I’ve been known for the faith aspect, I have several companies and I’ve owned my own resources. My children all started studying ancestry about Igbos, and even more about Africa. I’ll like to reconnect with our brothers and sisters over there.”</p><p>Jakes is the founder of <strong>The Potter’s House</strong>, a megachurch in Dallas, Texas from where he broadcasts to thousands if not millions of people on television.</p><p>Having visited Nigeria several times, he said he enjoys Fufu and Jollof rice.</p><p>“When I’m in Nigeria, I eat fufu and jollof rice. I have those kinds of experience. I’ve had more than I can name. I go to Accra in Ghana and Lagos quite often,” he added.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“What I know about the food is that it’s almost always hot and spicy. I ate it before but the food over there is so hot it makes your head sweat. And I like it.”</p><p>Jakes said he has urged his children to start studying more about the Igbos and Africans in general.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6vr8Ssq6uxXamytMCMpaCno6Nir6q%2Fx6inZqxdmXqrrcqeqmasn2LBqbGMop6bp12pv6quxGhscm9lrLS5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
