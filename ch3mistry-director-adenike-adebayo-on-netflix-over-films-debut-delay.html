Neither were we informed ahead, nor communicated with. We waited all day yesterday hoping that we’d have our release but that wasn’t the case. Up till this moment, our title can’t be found on @naijaonnetflix,” she stated.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Adebayo expressed her heartfelt apologies, recognising the frustration felt by fans who had been expecting the movie with great anticipation and she reassured that every effort is being made to find a quick solution.</p><p>“I know how frustrating this must be for a lot of people. Whatever you’re feeling about this situation, multiply by it 1000! That’s how we feel,” she said.</p><p>“We’re sorry we don’t have more definite update for you concerning this situation and we’re sorry for whatever inconveniences this might have caused you. We are trying our best to get an explanation and have this resolved asap. It is a rather disappointing turn of events but we will not be discouraged,” she wrote.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c9667d61-3ec9-4102-b459-305cc7228a1d data-caption="BTS from ‘Ch3mistry’ directed by Adenike Adedayo "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/oFMktkqTURBXy81ZTEyNzYzMjVmMDE5YmYyMjBmNzdhZjQxNTE3NDNjMC5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQShwsM></span> <span class=caption>BTS from ‘Ch3mistry’ directed by Adenike Adedayo</span> <span class=copyright>Pulse Nigeria</span><p>The movie Ch3mistry follows a story of a recently married couple, excited to experience their first sexual encounter.
