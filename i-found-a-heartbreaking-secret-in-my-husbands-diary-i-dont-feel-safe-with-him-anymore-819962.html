However, sometimes an&nbsp;unexpected discovery—seemingly harmless at&nbsp;first—can completely erode the trust we’ve built. A&nbsp;woman stumbled upon her husband’s diary and uncovered some truly disturbing details. Now, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;worried wife and mother, she’s left wondering, “Should I&nbsp;leave my&nbsp;husband right away?”</p><p><h2>Angela’s marriage to&nbsp;her husband began with a&nbsp;few warning signs.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3eb/05c/d6621d562cb12265882aace981.jpg><p>A&nbsp;33-year-old woman named Angela recently wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;us, sharing her story that stirred up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;emotions among&nbsp;us. She asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish her letter to&nbsp;seek advice from our readers and to&nbsp;hear their thoughts on&nbsp;the heartbreaking situation she’s currently facing.</p><p>Angela began her letter with, “My&nbsp;husband Andrew and&nbsp;I have been married for 5&nbsp;years now. We’ve known each other for a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;10&nbsp;years and dated for 3&nbsp;years before getting married. Our marriage was very happy, though it&nbsp;started with a&nbsp;red flag that&nbsp;I wish&nbsp;I hadn’t overlooked at&nbsp;the time.”</p><p>She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;reveal, “When Andrew proposed, I&nbsp;expected a&nbsp;beautiful engagement ring because he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;good income and had always been generous with gifts. He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;spoil me&nbsp;with expensive presents, so&nbsp;I naturally anticipated something special on&nbsp;that important day. But Andrew showed up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;very cheap ring, and when he&nbsp;noticed the slight disappointment on&nbsp;my&nbsp;face, he&nbsp;said, ’All material things are just things. You can’t take anything material with you to&nbsp;the grave, so&nbsp;you should be&nbsp;happy and grateful for what&nbsp;I feel for you, not what&nbsp;I give you.’”</p><p>Angela continued, “I’ve never been materialistic, so&nbsp;I didn’t dwell on&nbsp;the cheap ring. I&nbsp;just felt uneasy because of&nbsp;this sudden shift in&nbsp;his behavior. With our engagement, he&nbsp;went from being a&nbsp;sincere and generous man to&nbsp;someone who suddenly adopted a&nbsp;frugal philosophy that&nbsp;I don’t remember him having before. But I&nbsp;brushed it&nbsp;off and ignored his remarks about taking things to&nbsp;the grave. I&nbsp;was simply happy with what&nbsp;I had at&nbsp;that moment.”</p><p><h2>Everything seemed normal in&nbsp;their marriage until one day, things took a&nbsp;sudden turn.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8e/025/b6dd2355758653106d2ac8345f.jpg><p>Angela continues her story, saying, “Throughout our 5-year marriage, Andrew has kept a&nbsp;semi-regular diary. He&nbsp;never tried to&nbsp;hide&nbsp;it, and until now, I&nbsp;always respected his privacy. But after a&nbsp;heated argument one day, my&nbsp;intuition told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;read&nbsp;it. So, after he&nbsp;left for work, I&nbsp;did.”</p><p>As&nbsp;she flipped through the pages of&nbsp;her husband’s journal, Angela was horrified. “After reading his diary, I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I had never even touched it—I was so&nbsp;shocked and disgusted by&nbsp;what I&nbsp;found. My&nbsp;dear, beloved husband wrote several times that he&nbsp;hates&nbsp;me, and at&nbsp;one point, he&nbsp;even wrote that when&nbsp;I was sick, he&nbsp;hoped&nbsp;I would die.”</p><p>Angela explained, “We&nbsp;recently went through a&nbsp;rough patch that lasted about two weeks. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;difficult time for both of&nbsp;us, but&nbsp;I believe we&nbsp;got through it&nbsp;together. There were no&nbsp;moments where&nbsp;I felt afraid of&nbsp;him, just honest conversations about tough emotions.</p><p>Andrew’s expressions of&nbsp;hatred coincided with that rough period. The rest of&nbsp;the journal was quite ordinary and reflected the man&nbsp;I know and <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. It&nbsp;was filled with his thoughts on&nbsp;work and <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, his goals, and even habit tracking.”</p><p><h2>Angela has been struggling to&nbsp;sleep ever since she discovered what her husband truly thinks of&nbsp;her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/28a/28d/0362995af08232c363c6b6dd20.jpg><p>Angela shared, “When I&nbsp;read those words, I&nbsp;didn’t hesitate. I&nbsp;packed up&nbsp;my&nbsp;things and our daughter’s as&nbsp;well and went to&nbsp;stay with a&nbsp;friend. I&nbsp;took photos of&nbsp;all the diary pages as&nbsp;proof. I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I needed some space to&nbsp;cool off after our argument and that I’d be&nbsp;back soon. I’ve already booked a&nbsp;session with my&nbsp;therapist and even reached out to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawyer.”</p><p>She continued, “Since I&nbsp;left, my&nbsp;husband has sent me&nbsp;a&nbsp;few warm messages. He&nbsp;said he’s glad I’m taking some time for myself, that he’s looking forward to&nbsp;seeing me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I get back, and reassured me&nbsp;that it’s normal to&nbsp;have little bumps in&nbsp;the road. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;me, and it’s made me&nbsp;start to&nbsp;doubt my&nbsp;initial decision.”</p><p>But now, Angela is&nbsp;unsure of&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do. “I&nbsp;was convinced our <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> was over the moment&nbsp;I read that he&nbsp;hated&nbsp;me. Even the fact that&nbsp;I felt the need to&nbsp;invade his privacy showed me&nbsp;that something was seriously wrong in&nbsp;our marriage. Yet, all his warm messages and the other entries in&nbsp;his diary are making me&nbsp;second-guess myself,” she wrote.</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;while, things began to&nbsp;improve.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6c/6bb/fec316527cafe96b719ecee9a4.jpg><p>After a&nbsp;few days of&nbsp;back-and-forth messages, Angela’s husband reached out, asking if&nbsp;they could meet and talk. She hesitated at&nbsp;first but eventually agreed, hoping to&nbsp;gain some clarity. They chose a&nbsp;quiet cafe, a&nbsp;neutral place where they could discuss everything openly.</p><p>“When we&nbsp;met, he&nbsp;looked genuinely concerned,” Angela shared. “He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;missed me&nbsp;and our daughter and that he’d been reflecting a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;what had happened. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;regretted writing those things and that he&nbsp;never meant for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;find them.”</p><p>They talked for hours, diving into the issues that had been festering beneath the surface. Angela explained, “We&nbsp;both acknowledged that we&nbsp;hadn’t been <a href=# title=communicating data-link=tag>communicating</a> as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;we&nbsp;should have. We&nbsp;agreed that our relationship needed serious work if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;move forward.”</p><p>In&nbsp;the end, they decided to&nbsp;give their marriage another chance but with a&nbsp;clear plan in&nbsp;place. “We&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;family therapy together,” Angela wrote. “We&nbsp;both realize that we&nbsp;need professional help to&nbsp;repair the damage and rebuild trust. It’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;long road, and I’m still scared. But for the sake of&nbsp;our family, we’re going to&nbsp;try and make it&nbsp;work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuss6upZ1lkWK1pq3RrZmrnZGgtq%2BzjKycnKqVqXqquoymsGagpaivorrDrGSdoZGnxm61jJ2mp6xdm7KmuIysmJ%2BdXay2tbSMoaCmZZGjxq670Z5kcWlpboNzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
