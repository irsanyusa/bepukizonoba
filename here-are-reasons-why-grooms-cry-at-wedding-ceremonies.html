An interesting love story</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>There are grooms whose wedding stories do not take the normal route most others take.</p><p>For grooms who had to endure initial rejection from the bride’s parents, or those who had to fight hard and do a lot to get their own parents’ clearance to marry the girl of their dreams, watching that same woman walk slowly down the aisle towards them could result in a rush of emotions so intense that tears just start rolling down their cheeks uncontrollably.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>2. Mummy’s boys</h2></p><p>One of the possible reasons for grooms’ tears could be because of the closeness with their mothers.</p><p>Whether it’s just the natural connection a son has with his mum or the type that is often talked about in derisory terms, grooms who share any form of deep connection with their mothers could find it difficult holding back the tears, especially if they see mummy dabbing off those bitter-sweet tears that come when mothers realise their ‘little bird’ is leaving her nest.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>3. Overcome by emotions</h2></p><p>They say there’s something really moving about watching the woman of your dreams walk down the aisle as the cherubic sound of hymns rent the air in a chapel.</p><p>Or when you have to really take wedding vows and the priest declares you and her husband and wife… something magical seems to happen in those moments when it finally dawns of grooms that finally… their lives just got wound with someone else’s before God and man.</p><p>They say the feeling is an overwhelming one, and that’s one more reason why grooms cry at weddings.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>4. Just dramatic</h2></p><p>Though unlikely, one can’t totally disregard the possibility that one or two of those crying grooms could possibly have done so out of being unnecessarily extra dramatic at the ceremony.</p><p>Don’t take anything away from dramatic people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7x56pnmWRp7JuvsSaqqimo2LEqcWMoKmop52oeqS%2B2GaYrWWnmrGltc2gZJydopq6sLrInqpocZtptKi3wQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
