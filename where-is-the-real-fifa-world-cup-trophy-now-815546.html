Finally, the hosts defeated its neighbors, <a href=# title=Argentina data-link=tag>Argentina</a>, with a&nbsp;score of&nbsp;4-2. That day, team Uruguay lifted the FIFA main trophy for the first time in&nbsp;history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bee/c05/46e103570e87d16c51af5d4a27.png><p>That trophy was initially named Victory and was a&nbsp;gold-plated sterling silver sculpture of&nbsp;the Greek goddess of&nbsp;victory <a href=# title=Nike data-link=tag>Nike</a>, 14&nbsp;inches high. Nike was holding the cup over her head. It&nbsp;traveled to&nbsp;Montevideo for the first World Cup aboard an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Italian data-link=tag>Italian</a> passenger liner. Several years later, the trophy cup was renamed to&nbsp;honor Jules Rimet. He&nbsp;was FIFA’s third president who helped make soccer a&nbsp;global sport and start the World Cup. That much-desired award has seen a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;its life.</p><p>In&nbsp;1939, a&nbsp;very uneasy time in&nbsp;Europe, FIFA’s Italian vice president Otorino Barassi had to&nbsp;move the trophy from a&nbsp;bank vault and hide it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shoebox under his bed to&nbsp;save&nbsp;it. The trophy was passed over from winner to&nbsp;winner until 1970. That year, <a href=# title=Brazil data-link=tag>Brazil</a> won the World Cup for the third time and got to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it.</p><p>They would have never seen the original trophy but for a&nbsp;black-and-white mongrel named Pickles, who saved it&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years before. The World Cup was supposed to&nbsp;take place in&nbsp;<a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a>. The trophy was on&nbsp;display at&nbsp;a&nbsp;stamp exhibition in&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a>.</p><p>It&nbsp;was supervised 24/7, but a&nbsp;thief or&nbsp;maybe a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;thieves managed to&nbsp;break into the security case and steal the trophy on&nbsp;its second day on&nbsp;display. The search for the trophy began immediately. The thief demanded a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;money as&nbsp;ransom. Then, he&nbsp;was found and arrested. But the Cup wasn’t with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/212/372/5bdad053ecb1dfa05c3466bda4.png><p>And this is&nbsp;where Pickles came into action. A&nbsp;week after the theft, the mongrel was on&nbsp;his regular walk with the owner. He&nbsp;noticed something wrapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper beneath a&nbsp;hedge in&nbsp;the garden of&nbsp;his home in&nbsp;South London. Pickles made his owner, David Corbett, check out the find. He&nbsp;was very careful about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;something dangerous.</p><p>As&nbsp;David was unwrapping the newspaper, he&nbsp;realized the World Cup trophy itself was in&nbsp;his garden! Once it&nbsp;was confirmed that was, indeed, the real trophy, Pickles instantly became a&nbsp;celebrity as&nbsp;he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;many covers worldwide. His owner was given a&nbsp;reward of&nbsp;over $100,000 worth in&nbsp;today’s money, and Pickles received a&nbsp;life-long supply of&nbsp;dog food.</p><p>A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months later, her Majesty the <a href=# title=Queen data-link=tag>Queen</a> handed over the well-deserved award to&nbsp;England’s team captain. One of&nbsp;the players, Nobby Stiles, performed his famous jig on&nbsp;the pitch with the cup. While the trophy was missing, England’s Football Association secretly ordered a&nbsp;gilded bronze replica of&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;case the real thing would never be&nbsp;found.</p><p>England only got to&nbsp;hold the real trophy on&nbsp;the field. The officials came to&nbsp;their locker room to&nbsp;replace it&nbsp;with the replica that went on&nbsp;tour of&nbsp;the country for the following 4&nbsp;years. Then, as&nbsp;you already know, Brazil won the World Cup and got to&nbsp;keep the Jules Rimet Trophy for good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3cf/cb5/786ae159d1a93b2fb9058d58bc.png><p>FIFA announced a&nbsp;design competition to&nbsp;create the trophy for the next World Cup. Italian artist Silvio Gazzaniga offered the best design out of&nbsp;53&nbsp;submissions from 7&nbsp;countries. The new trophy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;statue of&nbsp;two athletes holding up&nbsp;a&nbsp;globe. Some people see a&nbsp;depiction of&nbsp;Pelé in&nbsp;it, the legendary Brazilian player who is&nbsp;the only one to&nbsp;have won 3&nbsp;World Cups. The artist never confirmed&nbsp;it, though. According to&nbsp;FIFA, the trophy is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;18-karat gold with bands of&nbsp;malachite on&nbsp;its base.</p><p>A&nbsp;chemist working at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Nottingham [Martyn Poliakoff] claims it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;made of&nbsp;solid gold. If&nbsp;that were the case, the trophy would have to&nbsp;weigh at&nbsp;least 150 pounds as&nbsp;gold is&nbsp;a&nbsp;really dense material. No&nbsp;one from the winning team would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;lift it&nbsp;over their heads so&nbsp;easily. Plus, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge waste of&nbsp;gold. So, the scientist is&nbsp;sure the globe in&nbsp;the statue has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hollow. So, the trophy weighs just around 13&nbsp;pounds. It&nbsp;has an&nbsp;engraving “FIFA World Cup” on&nbsp;its base.</p><p>After 1994, they added a&nbsp;plate to&nbsp;the bottom side with the names of&nbsp;winning countries engraved on&nbsp;it. The inscriptions always have the year in&nbsp;figures and the name of&nbsp;the country in&nbsp;its national language. They replace the plate each World Cup cycle, and the names are rearranged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;spiral to&nbsp;save space. But still, there’s most likely only room for a&nbsp;couple more country names on&nbsp;the base, so&nbsp;FIFA will have to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;with some new idea or&nbsp;a&nbsp;replacement by&nbsp;2038.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b22/646/b727ef53f18c65f0009d5d5728.png><p>The trophy no&nbsp;longer travels from winning team to&nbsp;winning team. Now the champions only get a&nbsp;bronze replica which is&nbsp;gold-plated, and they can keep&nbsp;it. The original award stays at&nbsp;the FIFA World Football Museum in&nbsp;Zurich, <a href=# title=Switzerland data-link=tag>Switzerland</a>. It&nbsp;only leaves when it&nbsp;goes on&nbsp;its FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour.</p><p>On&nbsp;its 2022&nbsp;tour, the trophy is&nbsp;set to&nbsp;visit 51&nbsp;countries. The big plan is&nbsp;for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit all 211 member associations by&nbsp;2030, the World Cup’s 100th anniversary. It&nbsp;also attends the Final draw for the next World Cup and is&nbsp;present on&nbsp;the pitch at&nbsp;the World Cup opening game and Final. The tradition of&nbsp;lifting up&nbsp;the trophy in&nbsp;the air started at&nbsp;the 1958 World Cup in&nbsp;Sweden. A&nbsp;photographer asked the Brazilian team captain to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;better view in&nbsp;the photos. Every champion team captain has done it&nbsp;ever since.</p><p>The winning team doesn’t only bring home the desired trophy but also a&nbsp;good cash bonus of&nbsp;around $40&nbsp;million. The runners-up, second and third runners-up, and even group stages winners also get a&nbsp;nice 6-figure remuneration. So&nbsp;far, Brazil, <a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a>, Italy, Argentina, France, Uruguay, England, and Spain have won the Cup. Plus, there are at&nbsp;least 2&nbsp;original cups, so&nbsp;there must be&nbsp;around 10&nbsp;trophies and official replicas in&nbsp;the world, right? Well, even FIFA itself can’t tell you that because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;truly detective story that happened in&nbsp;1983 in&nbsp;Brazil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6c7/87a/f732d550299f4778f5058056ad.png><p>Back then, the Brazilian Football Confederation placed the first original Jules Rimet trophy on&nbsp;display in&nbsp;their office. As&nbsp;you know, it&nbsp;was now Brazil’s permanent award for having the most victories. One December evening, a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;thieves managed to&nbsp;tie the building’s security, opened the wooden frame of&nbsp;the bulletproof glass box, and took the trophy. There was also a&nbsp;replica in&nbsp;the office, but the thieves weren’t interested in&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;they came for the real thing only.</p><p>Then, the search for the cup started. The Rio de&nbsp;Janeiro State Bank offered a&nbsp;hefty reward for the trophy’s safe return. The president of&nbsp;the Brazilian Football Confederation addressed the nation, saying that “the spiritual value of&nbsp;the cup is&nbsp;much greater than its material worth.” The appeal didn’t work, and no&nbsp;one has seen the trophy ever since.</p><p>The most popular version is&nbsp;that someone melted it&nbsp;down into gold bars in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;many Brazilian foundries. Or&nbsp;maybe it’s hidden in&nbsp;some collector’s basement or&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shoebox under their bed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f44/46b/1d00eb5306b260e7175f7c329b.png><p>Or&nbsp;maybe, just maybe, it&nbsp;never left England after Pickles had found&nbsp;it. The Football Association then gave the trophy to&nbsp;a&nbsp;jeweler named George Bird. He&nbsp;was the one who made the gilded bronze copy of&nbsp;the award. The English team waved that replica to&nbsp;the public.</p><p>4&nbsp;years later, it&nbsp;was time for the original trophy to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;FIFA. But it’s possible that they received a&nbsp;copy instead, and the real thing stayed under Bird’s bed. A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years after he&nbsp;passed away, his family auctioned what they thought was a&nbsp;replica of&nbsp;the trophy.</p><p>FIFA bought it&nbsp;for around $380,000. They then took it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;jeweler to&nbsp;find out it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;replica worth $2,250. That must have been one big disappointment!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpsdGeZKKrXam1pnnRnpilZZaes6J51qippZxdmMKxedOrpqmgqWK7sMOMcWhubWRrfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
