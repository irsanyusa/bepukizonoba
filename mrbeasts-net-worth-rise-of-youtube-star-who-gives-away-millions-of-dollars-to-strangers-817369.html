He’s not just another content creator, he’s one of&nbsp;the most-watched and highest-earning folks on&nbsp;the platform. In&nbsp;his early days, Donaldson gained widespread attention with viral videos that involved undertaking remarkable challenges, such as&nbsp;reading the entire dictionary or&nbsp;counting from zero to&nbsp;100,000 continuously for 40&nbsp;hours.</p><p>But here’s the cool <a href=# title=part data-link=tag>part</a>&nbsp;— lately, he’s become <strong>the philanthropy king of&nbsp;YouTube</strong>. A&nbsp;notable example is&nbsp;a&nbsp;video in&nbsp;which <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;“cures” the blindness</a> of&nbsp;1,000 people by&nbsp;covering the expenses for their eye surgeries. Thanks to&nbsp;his daring challenges and generous giveaways, MrBeast has successfully amassed a&nbsp;staggering <strong>234 million subscribers</strong> on&nbsp;his channel, making him the most subscribed creator in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;YouTube.</p><p><h2>Childhood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ca/abc/d47ea858db8e6f04c364cf1d40.jpg><p>James Stephen Donaldson, born on&nbsp;May&nbsp;7, 1998, hails from Wichita, Kansas, and spent most of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> in&nbsp;Greenville, North Carolina, under the care of&nbsp;his mother, Sue Donaldson. Life wasn’t static for him; frequent moves and long working hours for his parents, who were in&nbsp;the military, led to&nbsp;him being looked after by&nbsp;au&nbsp;pairs. Unfortunately, his parents went through a&nbsp;divorce in&nbsp;2007.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, James graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a&nbsp;cozy private evangelical Christian high school in&nbsp;the region. Although he&nbsp;initially enrolled at&nbsp;East Carolina University, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;drop out shortly after. What followed was an&nbsp;intriguing chapter in&nbsp;his life.</p><p>Post-dropout, James and his buddies delved into the mysteries of&nbsp;YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. Their mission? <strong>Decode the secrets to&nbsp;creating videos that would go&nbsp;viral</strong>. James vividly remembers this period, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “There’s a&nbsp;five-year point in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life where&nbsp;I was just relentlessly, unhealthily obsessed with studying virality, studying the YouTube algorithm. I&nbsp;woke&nbsp;up, Uber Eats food, and then spent the entire day on&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer studying nonstop with other YouTubers.”</p><p>Quite the journey from school to&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-made YouTube expert! At&nbsp;this time, Jimmy had no&nbsp;idea that one day the most influential journals would write articles with the title <strong>MrBeast’s Net Worth</strong>.</p><p><h2>Uploaded his first video, when he&nbsp;was just 13&nbsp;years old.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3c/aac/29603450eb9bf27fc3dfb8a36e.jpg><p>Back in&nbsp;2012, at&nbsp;the tender age of&nbsp;13, Donaldson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dipped</a> his toes into the YouTube waters, adopting the moniker “MrBeast6000.” His early videos were a&nbsp;mixed bag&nbsp;— ranging from Let’s Plays with a&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;Minecraft and Call of&nbsp;Duty: Black Ops II&nbsp;to&nbsp;estimating the wealth of&nbsp;fellow YouTubers, offering tips for aspiring creators, and chiming in&nbsp;on&nbsp;YouTube drama. In&nbsp;those early days, Donaldson himself didn’t feature prominently in&nbsp;those videos.</p><p>Fast-forward to&nbsp;2016, and things started heating up&nbsp;for Donaldson. He&nbsp;<strong>made a&nbsp;splash on&nbsp;the YouTube scene</strong> with his “Worst intros on&nbsp;YouTube” series, playfully poking fun at&nbsp;video introductions. By&nbsp;mid-2016, he&nbsp;had amassed around 30,000&nbsp;subscribers. That fall, Donaldson threw caution to&nbsp;the wind, <strong>dropped out of&nbsp;East Carolina University</strong>, and went full throttle into a&nbsp;career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;YouTuber. Mom wasn’t too thrilled about&nbsp;it, though; she gave him the boot from the family nest.</p><p>As&nbsp;his channel soared, Donaldson brought in&nbsp;some familiar faces&nbsp;— childhood buddies Kris Tyson, Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin. Franklin bid his farewells in&nbsp;2020, making room for Karl Jacobs, who got the nod after starting as&nbsp;the cameraman. Quite the journey from dorm life to&nbsp;YouTube stardom with a&nbsp;crew of&nbsp;friends!</p><p><h2>Meteoric rise on&nbsp;YouTube</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31d/2e9/d562fb5a9ba607f735f5b9adf7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2017, Jimmy did something wild&nbsp;— <strong>he&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>filmed</strong></a><strong> himself counting to&nbsp;100,000 for almost a&nbsp;whole day</strong>! It&nbsp;took him a&nbsp;whopping 40&nbsp;hours, and he&nbsp;even sped up&nbsp;some parts to&nbsp;“keep it&nbsp;under 24&nbsp;hours.” This crazy video became his big breakthrough and shot him to&nbsp;internet stardom.</p><p>During this time, he&nbsp;pulled off all sorts of&nbsp;wild stunts, like trying <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to&nbsp;break glass</a> with a&nbsp;hundred megaphones, attempting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;24-hour underwater challenge</a> (which didn’t quite work out due to&nbsp;health issues), and an&nbsp;unsuccessful attempt to&nbsp;spin a&nbsp;fidget spinner for an&nbsp;entire day. By&nbsp;2018, Donaldson had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>given away $1&nbsp;million</strong> </a>through his outrageous antics, earning him the title of&nbsp;“YouTube’s biggest philanthropist.”</p><p>In&nbsp;the epic battle between PewDiePie and T-Series for the most subscribers in&nbsp;2018, Jimmy went all out. He&nbsp;bought billboards, aired&nbsp;<a href=# title=TV data-link=tag>TV</a> and radio ads, and even took over multiple seats at&nbsp;Super Bowl LIII with his team, wearing shirts that said “Sub 2&nbsp;PewDiePie.”</p><p>March 2019 brought a&nbsp;real-life battle royale competition <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>organized</a> by&nbsp;Donaldson in&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>, with <strong>a&nbsp;whopping $200,000 prize</strong> (split into two games). Apex Legends joined the party as&nbsp;the event’s sponsor.</p><p>Then came a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;controversy in&nbsp;November 2019 when Jimmy was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accused</a> of&nbsp;using fake money in&nbsp;a&nbsp;video titled “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>I&nbsp;Opened A&nbsp;FREE BANK.</a>” He&nbsp;clarified that it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;ensure participant safety, and everyone got real checks after the shoot.</p><p>April 2020 saw Donaldson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>creating</a> a&nbsp;<a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a>, paper, scissors competition stream with 32&nbsp;influencers, offering <strong>a&nbsp;grand prize of&nbsp;$250,000</strong>. It&nbsp;became YouTube’s most-watched live Original event at&nbsp;the time, with 662,000 concurrent viewers. The event was won by&nbsp;Nadeshot. Later in&nbsp;October 2020, Jimmy hosted a&nbsp;trivia tournament with 24&nbsp;competitors and <strong>a&nbsp;grand prize of&nbsp;$300,000</strong>. The D’Amelio siblings, Charli and Dixie, took the win, sparking a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;controversy with claims of&nbsp;cheating. It’s safe to&nbsp;say, MrBeast knows how to&nbsp;keep the internet buzzing!</p><p><h2>Unparalleled subscriber growth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c9a/8f9/ceadaf5616a67f7dcd1cc2cc0e.jpg><p>Come November 2021, MrBeast uploaded “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>$456,000 Squid Game in&nbsp;Real Life!</a>”&nbsp;— a&nbsp;real-life rendition of&nbsp;the Squid Game series, attracting 456 participants competing for a&nbsp;$456,000 cash prize. The video quickly became one of&nbsp;2021’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>most-watched on&nbsp;YouTube</a>, amassing over 130 million views within a&nbsp;week. Some critics argued it&nbsp;misunderstood Squid Game’s anti-capitalist message, but the show’s creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, responded positively.</p><p>In&nbsp;January 2022, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Forbes crowned him YouTube’s highest-earning creator,</strong></a> estimating his 2021 earnings at&nbsp;$54 million&nbsp;— a&nbsp;sum that would have placed him 40th in&nbsp;the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100.</p><p>Fast-forward to&nbsp;2022, and Donaldson reached a&nbsp;milestone, surpassing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>100 million subscribers</strong></a><strong> </strong>on&nbsp;his main channel&nbsp;— the fifth channel and second individual YouTuber to&nbsp;achieve this.</p><p>In&nbsp;2022, he&nbsp;clinched <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>the Guinness World Record for “Most Subscribers for an&nbsp;Individual Male on&nbsp;YouTube”</strong></a> with 112,193,139 subscribers on&nbsp;his MrBeast channel, surpassing PewDiePie’s almost ten-year record. In&nbsp;November, Donaldson amassed one billion video views in&nbsp;30&nbsp;days on&nbsp;his main YouTube channel.</p><p>In&nbsp;2023, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>soared</a> past 200 million subscribers. His YouTube Shorts video, “Would You Fly To&nbsp;Paris For A&nbsp;Baguette?” holds the record as&nbsp;the most-watched video on&nbsp;his main channel, boasting over 1&nbsp;billion views and 40&nbsp;million likes as&nbsp;of&nbsp;January 2024.</p><p><h2>How much has he&nbsp;earned on&nbsp;YouTube?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eeb/204/bb27835f25a9696b45d1fa9c20.jpg><p>YouTube star became a&nbsp;sensation, securing a&nbsp;spot on&nbsp;the 2022 Forbes list as&nbsp;the highest-paid creator. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>MrBeast’s Net Worth is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;$500&nbsp;million</strong></a>. Unsurprisingly, the primary source of&nbsp;his income is&nbsp;his YouTube channel, where a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;ad&nbsp;revenue, sponsored content, and brand partnerships has transformed his passion into a&nbsp;thriving business. Each video serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;valuable asset, contributing significantly to&nbsp;the exponential growth of&nbsp;his net worth.</p><p>Believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, he&nbsp;rakes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;minimum of<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>$3&nbsp;million monthly just from YouTube ads</strong></a>, and that doesn’t even count the brand deals woven into his videos. What’s intriguing is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;funnels most of&nbsp;his earnings back into video production, often splurging up&nbsp;to&nbsp;$300,000&nbsp;on a&nbsp;single video.</p><p>What sets MrBeast apart is&nbsp;his unique philanthropic touch. His stunts go&nbsp;beyond just <a href=# title=entertainment data-link=tag>entertainment</a>, often involving acts of&nbsp;kindness like giving money to&nbsp;strangers or&nbsp;rescuing an&nbsp;entire shelter of&nbsp;dogs. It’s not just about the numbers; it’s about making a&nbsp;positive impact.</p><p><h2>Expanding business ventures</h2></p><p><h2><strong>Finger on&nbsp;the App</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df6/e3b/ed726558a2aa509d4592cdbf84.jpg><p>In&nbsp;June 2020, Donaldson collaborated with the Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF to&nbsp;launch a&nbsp;unique mobile game, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Finger on&nbsp;the App</strong></a>. In&nbsp;this multiplayer game, players competed to&nbsp;keep their finger on&nbsp;the phone screen, with the last person standing winning $25,000. The game’s success led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;sequel, Finger on&nbsp;the App&nbsp;2, which, after delays, featured a&nbsp;grand prize of&nbsp;$100,000. The winner endured 51&nbsp;hours with their finger on&nbsp;the screen, earning the top prize, while the second-place finisher received $20,000.</p><p><h2><strong>MrBeast Burger</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d81/626/40fcb25382ab6d337b176788cc.jpg><p>Venturing into the culinary realm, Donaldson expanded his ventures. In&nbsp;December 2020, he&nbsp;introduced <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>MrBeast Burger</strong></a>, a&nbsp;virtual restaurant offering franchise rights to&nbsp;serve its burgers across the U.S. In&nbsp;August 2022, the first physical MrBeast Burger shop opened in&nbsp;the American Dream Mall near New York City.</p><p>However, by&nbsp;June&nbsp;17, 2023, Donaldson expressed regret over MrBeast Burger, citing concerns about quality and an&nbsp;unfavorable deal with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC. Despite his desire to&nbsp;shut it&nbsp;down, legal disputes with Virtual Dining Concepts ensued in&nbsp;July 2023, with Donaldson suing to&nbsp;end their partnership, claiming damage to&nbsp;his reputation and unpaid fees. Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the allegations, asserting Donaldson’s growth was tied to&nbsp;MrBeast Burger.</p><p><h2><strong>Feastables Chocolate</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc8/13a/3170da5fe98d6b77dbe9672310.jpg><p>In&nbsp;January 2022, Donaldson ventured into the food industry again with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Feastables</strong></a>, launching MrBeast Bars, a&nbsp;brand of&nbsp;chocolate bars. The launch included sweepstakes with over $1&nbsp;million in&nbsp;prizes, culminating in&nbsp;a&nbsp;video where participants competed for a&nbsp;chocolate factory or&nbsp;a&nbsp;$500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay judged the final challenge. Feastables reportedly <strong>earned</strong> <strong>$10 million in&nbsp;its initial months</strong>.</p><p>On&nbsp;March&nbsp;3, 2023, Donaldson stirred controversy by&nbsp;asking fans to&nbsp;enhance the presentation of&nbsp;Feastables displays in&nbsp;stores and obscure competing products, offering entry into a&nbsp;$5,000 raffle as&nbsp;an&nbsp;incentive. This move faced criticism for potentially exploiting fans for unpaid labor.</p><p><h2>Philanthropy</h2></p><p><h2><strong>Team Trees</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/343/3b4/a21f9051e99f7d9d7ac7b9850a.jpg><p>Even though <strong>MrBeast’s Net Worth</strong> has reached an&nbsp;unprecedented size, he&nbsp;remains a&nbsp;human with a&nbsp;big heart.</p><p>In&nbsp;2019, Jimmy and former NASA engineer Mark Rober joined forces for #<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>TeamTrees</strong></a>, a&nbsp;YouTube fundraising challenge. The aim: raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by&nbsp;January&nbsp;1, 2020, and plant trees by&nbsp;December 2022. Every dollar donated equaled one planted tree. Popular YouTubers like Rhett &&nbsp;Link, Marshmello, and others supported the cause.</p><p>By&nbsp;October 2019, tree planting began in&nbsp;US national parks. The project surpassed its goal on&nbsp;December&nbsp;19, receiving notable donations from figures like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk. As&nbsp;of&nbsp;December&nbsp;18, 2023, over 24.5 million trees have been planted.</p><p><h2><strong>Beast Philanthropy</strong></h2></p><p>On&nbsp;September&nbsp;17, 2020, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Beast Philanthropy</strong></a> was launched, with all revenue going to&nbsp;charity. Initiatives included gifting 10,000 turkeys to&nbsp;Greenville, donating 20,000 shoes to&nbsp;African children, building 100 wells for clean water access in&nbsp;Africa, and providing $300,000 worth of&nbsp;technology to&nbsp;schools.</p><p><h2><strong>Team Seas</strong></h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2021, MrBeast and Rober initiated #<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>TeamSeas</strong></a>, aiming to&nbsp;raise $30 million by&nbsp;January&nbsp;1, 2022, for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup. The funds would aid in&nbsp;removing 30&nbsp;million pounds of&nbsp;plastic from oceans. Collaborating with numerous content creators, they successfully engaged a&nbsp;global community of&nbsp;eight million creators to&nbsp;support the cause.</p><p><h2>Personal life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59e/9aa/deb3ed522da8dbe48314cbff94.jpg><p>MrBeast openly acknowledges his introverted disposition, linking it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his unwavering dedication to&nbsp;YouTube and a&nbsp;robust work ethic. His mother, Sue, ties his reserved lifestyle to&nbsp;the frequent relocations and his struggles with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Crohn’s disease</a>. In&nbsp;2022, Jimmy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about living with this diagnosis, “I’m probably one of&nbsp;the least energetic people you’ll ever meet. I&nbsp;get tired very easily. I&nbsp;take a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;naps and stuff like that.”</p><p>Having been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relationship</a> with YouTuber Maddy Spidell from 2019 to&nbsp;2022, MrBeast is&nbsp;currently dating gaming streamer Thea Booysen. Since they’ve been together, viewers got a&nbsp;peek into MrBeast and his girlfriend’s life.</p><p>A&nbsp;recent <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> photo unveiled the influencer’s transformed physique. The 25-year-old revealed his dedication to&nbsp;weightlifting for 10&nbsp;months, coupled with a&nbsp;daily 12,000-step walk. Dietary adjustments and prioritizing a&nbsp;good night’s sleep played integral roles in&nbsp;his transformative journey. Summing it&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;humorously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a>, “I’ve gone from obese to&nbsp;just lean,” expressing newfound respect for fitness enthusiasts and joking, “this takes forever lol.”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;subsequent tweet, MrBeast celebrated an&nbsp;impressive&nbsp;20% reduction in&nbsp;body fat since embarking on&nbsp;his weight loss journey. While teasing before-and-after pictures, he&nbsp;playfully added that eager fans would have to&nbsp;wait for another six months of&nbsp;dedicated gym efforts.</p><p>If&nbsp;you think it’s impossible to&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>spend $650 million in&nbsp;13&nbsp;years</strong></a>, make sure to&nbsp;read our article to&nbsp;learn <strong>how Johnny Depp spent most of&nbsp;his fortune in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few years</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqzrsSaqq2rXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ntrSxjKidZrGfqsG2rsRmqq2ZomLEqbuMoKCvnaNirrit2GakoqScnryvv4yonWacn6G5or7SZquoZaOpv6K6xp6prGVoZoR0gpho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
