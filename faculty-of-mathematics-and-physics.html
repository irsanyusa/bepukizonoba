Please make sure to upload with your application all the required documents as specified above. For TOEFL, SAT, ACT and IB, you should have your test scores sent directly to Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics. Here are our institution codes:&nbsp;<strong>TOEFL&nbsp;</strong>3184,&nbsp;<strong>SAT</strong>&nbsp;7249,&nbsp;<strong>ACT</strong>&nbsp;6790,&nbsp;<strong>IB</strong>&nbsp;000147.</p><p>The&nbsp;application fee&nbsp;is 760 CZK&nbsp;(around 30&nbsp;EUR). Please note that an application cannot be processed without the required documents having been received, nor can it be processed if the application fee has not been paid. Also, for enrolment we require an official copy of every document that you have submitted with your application (i.e., to submit your application a&nbsp;scanned copy of the relevant document is sufficient, but to complete the admission process you must provide an official document – e.g., a&nbsp;copy verified by a&nbsp;notary, or an original).</p><p>Notification: All wire transfer fees are paid by applicants.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;What happens then?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>After we have received your complete application, the review committee will carefully process all applications.

If your application is not successful, you will receive a&nbsp;letter from us as well to be informed properly.</p><p><strong>Tuition Fees for Bachelor’s and Master’s&nbsp;Programmes:</strong></p><ul><li>The tuition fee for students from the EU is 84 000 CZK (around 3100 EUR) per academic year, for students from outside the EU 140 000 CZK (around 5100 EUR) per academic year.</li></ul><p><strong>Tuition Fee for PhD Programmes:</strong></p><ul><li>150 000 CZK (around 5800 EUR) per academic year. Exceptional students may consider applying for a&nbsp;tuition fee waiver. The final decision on awarding a&nbsp; tuition fee waiver rests with the dean of the faculty and is based on the academic performance of the applicant in his/her previous education, research activity around the intended research topic, language skills, and ability to cooperate with others. An application for a&nbsp;tuition fee waiver, including supporting material, should be submitted together with the application for the PhD programme.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Kaq5qkn5zCpnnOn2SuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtfmLWivsueqmatnp7Dpr7SoquyZ5aWsLa407JkqJ5doq61tMSmmK2hk6h6orrDZqehsaOesLQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
