How do you know if you’re doing or making something?&nbsp;</p><p>Just like<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> mispronouncing a word</a> or using the wrong verb tense, this is one of those things that can cause<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> English learners</a> a lot of stress.</p><p>Luckily, there are some rules to help you understand the major differences between “make” and “do”, which we’ll get into below.</p><p>But the truth is that not every rule is as straightforward as you might like (a common theme in English<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> grammar</a>, unfortunately). In those cases, the best thing you can do is to learn common<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> collocations</a>—sets of words that just “sound right” together.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, we’ll go through some of the “do” vs. “make” guidelines, common collocations and phrases, and examples to give you some context and an idea of how you can use them.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id='The-basic-difference-between-"do"-and-"make"'><strong>The basic difference between “do” and “make”</strong></h2><p>At first glance, “do” and “make” might seem to have similar meanings, as they both encompass activities involving actions or tasks. They also tend to translate to the one word in many languages. However, a deeper analysis reveals a fundamental difference in their application.</p><p>In essence, “do” generally refers to performing actions or repetitive tasks viewed as necessary, mundane, or routine. It’s also used to form&nbsp; common phrases and collocations, such as ”do a job” or ”<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">do business</a>.”</p><p>Conversely, “make” typically involves creating or producing something tangible or intangible. However, it can also be used to form certain collocations, just like ”do”, such as “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">make a phone call</a>” or “make friends”, which have nothing to do with creating an object.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-“make”-><strong>When to use “make”&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In general, you use “make” to talk about the result of an action, not the action itself. Results are often things you can see or touch. Here are the most common categories:</p><ul><li>Food and drinks – cookies, lunch</li><li>Construction and art projects – a bookshelf, a vase</li><li>Finances – money, a profit</li></ul><p>You can also “make” things that aren’t visible. These are still considered results because they’re the outcomes of things you decide to do. Some examples of things you can make are:</p><ul><li>Plans</li><li>Offers</li><li>Suggestions</li><li>Choices</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id='Common-English-collocations-with-"make"'><strong>Common English collocations with “make”</strong></h2><p>Here are a few common collocations you can learn that only use “make”—never “do.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Make breakfast/lunch/dinner</strong></h3><p>“I don’t feel like making dinner tonight.

Understanding common collocations and contextual usage helps determine which to use.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is it make or do exercises?</strong></h3><p>It’s typically “do exercises.” “Do” is commonly used with activities or tasks, while “make” is more about creation or production. So, you “do” exercises, as they are activities.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is it making activities or doing activities?</strong></h3><p>It depends on the context. Generally, “doing activities” is more common, as “do” often refers to actions or tasks. However, “making activities” might imply creating activities or designing them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Do you do or make a project?</strong></h3><p>It’s more common to say “do a project.” “Do” is typically used for tasks or actions, including completing a project.
