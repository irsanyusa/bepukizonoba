The <a href=#>former</a> approach would see those caught in possession of cannabis subject to no criminal penalties, whilst the latter would allow the sale and use of the substance within government regulations.</p><p>New YouGov data finds that Londoners support decriminalising cannabis within the boundaries of the capital by 50% to 33%. However opinion is divided across party lines, with 64% of the capital’s Labour voters supporting such a move compared to only 34% of Conservative voters.</p><p>Younger Londoners are also notably more likely to support a change in the law, with 52% of 18-24s and 56% of 25–49-year-olds supporting decriminalisation, versus 45% of 50-64 year olds and 34% of those aged 65 and over.</p><h3>What do Londoners think the impact of decriminalising cannabis in the capital would be on crime?</h3><p>Drug related crime in the UK last year accounted for 210,000 offences, according to <a href=#>government statistics</a>, with 63% of drug related offences involving possession of cannabis. One in three Londoners (33%) believe that decriminalising cannabis in the capital would lead to less crime, while one in four (23%) think it would lead to more. Another quarter (26%) think it would make no difference.</p><p>Two in five (41%) also believe that relaxing the rules would decrease the amount of pressure on the Metropolitan police, whilst a quarter (24%) instead believe it would increase pressure on them.</p><p>Among those who oppose decriminalising cannabis, a majority believe that the relaxation in the law would increase the amount of crime (55%) and increase pressure on the Metropolitan Police (53%).</p><h3>What do Londoners think the impact of decriminalising cannabis in the capital would be on how many people use drugs?</h3><p>When it comes to the implications of relaxing the rules for the rate of drug use, Londoners are divided. While 39% think decriminalisation would lead to more people using cannabis in the capital, nearly half think it would either make no difference (41%) or see numbers fall (5%).</p><p>Cannabis has famously been referred to as a <a href=#>‘gateway drug’</a> i.e. the idea that use of cannabis softens the user’s impression of ‘harder’ drugs, which subsequently increases their chances of using them.</p><p>Half of Londoners do not seem to buy this idea, believing that the decriminalisation of cannabis in the capital would either reduce (14%), or have no effect (38%) upon the number of people choosing to use drugs besides cannabis. A quarter (27%), however, believe it would lead to greater use of other drugs, rising to 63% amongst those who oppose decriminalisation of cannabis in the capital.</p><h3>What do Londoners think the impact of decriminalising cannabis in the capital would be on drug-related health issues?</h3><p>The UK now has one of the <a href=#>highest rates</a> of drug related deaths in Europe. Londoners are divided on what the impact of the decriminalisation of cannabis would be on drug-related health harms.</p><p>Three in ten (30%) believe that decriminalising cannabis in the capital would have no impact on the rate of drug-related health issues overall, while a third (35%) think it would lead to more drug-related health harm.</p><p>A further 15% believe that relaxing the rules would lead to fewer drug-related harms. Three quarters (74%) of those who oppose the decriminalisation of cannabis believe the policy would lead to more people damaging their health due to their drug taking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZm1rZmuBbrDEnKmipZmjrq210qKloGWTlruvrcGiqmakn6OxsLqMsJ%2BarF2ZvG64zqebqKaVp8Bu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
