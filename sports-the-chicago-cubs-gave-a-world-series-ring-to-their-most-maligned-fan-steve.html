The Cubs went on to blow the lead in that game and a chance at going to the World Series.</p><p>After the incident, Bartman became the face of the Cubs' seemingly never-ending failures. He received death threats, became a punchline to jokes, and was forced into seclusion.</p><p>Now, with their long sought after World Series win behind them, the Rickett family felt it was time to reach out, and gave Bartman a Championship ring in an effort to both close a chapter and let Bartman know that the organization is thankful to have him as a fan.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It's quite a gift, with estimates placing its value at <a href=# id=84a9ccf7-2f2f-5539-a55e-315b0bb499f9>around $70,000</a>.</p><p>Along with the announcement of the gift, the Cubs gave WGN an official statement, that notably acknowledges the struggle that Bartman has unfairly endured over the past 14 years:</p><p>"I humbly receive the ring not only as a symbol of one of the most historic achievements in sports, but as an important reminder for how we should treat each other in todayâ€™s society. My hope is that we all can learn from my experience to view sports as entertainment and prevent harsh scapegoating, and to challenge the media and opportunistic profiteers to conduct business ethically by respecting personal privacy rights and not exploit any individual to advance their own self-interest or economic gain.</p><p>Moreover, I am hopeful this ring gesture will be the start of an important healing and reconciliation process for all involved. To that end, I request the media please respect my privacy, and the privacy of my family. I will not participate in interviews or further public statements at this time.</p><p>Words alone cannot express my heartfelt thanks to the Ricketts family, Crane Kenney, Theo Epstein, and the entire Cubs organization for this extraordinary gift, and for providing the City of Chicago and Cubs fans everywhere an unforgettable World Championship in 2016. I am happy to be reunited with the Cubs family and positively moving forward with my life."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9GtqmasmJp6pLTInJigp12YwqO%2FjKCYr51dlnq4u9Glm2arlae2pr%2BMq6Cnn12pvG7Ax56gq2WdpMC1ecyao6KfnpqxbrLAp2SsrJWrsnDDl6WqbnCV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
