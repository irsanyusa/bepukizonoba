And here’s the reason: some people really just can’t handle the truth. It does not make them bad people or bad partners; they're not just wired to be calm or stay sane in the face of certain revelations.</p><p>So instead of risking something beautiful over an inconsequential detail that’ll likely not hurt anyone if forever locked away in a vault, just keep mum and continue coasting with the love of your life.</p><p>Here are 7 times when it’s OK to leave some things unsaid;</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7303768b-7982-4f0d-a8e4-74c258a86ea0 data-caption="No one needs graphic details of your sexual past.

Your sexual history</h2></p><p>For real, not many boyfriends/girlfriends want to hear the step by step narration and graphic details of how you had sex in a bathroom stall at the mall with your ex or some random babe.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2. Your body count</h2></p><p>As we already discussed in detail here, for the ladies, only your doctor and/or gynecologist deserves this information.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3. That someone at work [or anywhere] has a crush on you</h2></p><p>Really, this is literally opening the door for problems no one wants. Here’s the thing about revealing this information – you put your partner in a position to have his imagination roam and become paranoid.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-0842984e-302a-4b6e-80d0-33a08c224457 data-caption="Don't stress yourself explaining how many people have a crush on you.

That you have a crush on someone else</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Being genuinely in love with a man or woman does not magically take away the inclination to be attracted or to fall in love with other people.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>5. That you don’t like their parents</h2></p><p>I’m not sure anyone wants to hear her boyfriend say he does not like her mum. Neither is there any guy who would stand for that.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The only time this may be OK is when you no longer value the relationship and you’re willing to let go of it.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9237d781-4f0a-4583-9176-b59c1652e11a data-caption="Do you think your partner would want to know that you don't like their parents or family?

You’re going to come off as distrustful and things may just go downhill from there. Better keep the info to yourself.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-25>7. That you still stalk his ex</h2></p><p>Ladies, your boyfriend does not need to know that you have been stalking his ex on social media. You’ll come off as insecure and you don’t need that.</p><p>Same thing goes for guys. You really so not want to give off the vibe of insecurity. Your babe does not need that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7x56pnmWRp7Jug4ytn6Kml6h6urvUq2SpmaKpu6a%2BjJ2mnqtdo7y1ec2enJ1lpKR6rLrOsGSamp%2BqwW7Fzq5msKyiZcZ2tA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
