The proud father opened up during an interview, expressing his support for Eric’s budding interest in showbiz.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eric-cowell-was-inspired-to-audition-after-attending-agt-show>Eric Cowell Was Inspired to Audition After Attending AGT Show</h2><p>Nine-year-old Eric Cowell, seated to his father’s left during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a> Season 18 live episodes, has become a source of amusement and inspiration for Simon. The charismatic judge couldn’t help but share how his son’s enthusiastic reactions during the acts brought joy to his role as a judge. He recalled one particularly wild performance involving sword swallowing and Cowell’s animated response that had the whole audience amused.</p><p>In the eyes of Cowell, his son is more than just an adorable sidekick; he’s a reliable “barometer” for talent on the show. According to the judge, kids like his can’t be swayed by artificial applause or empty praise. Their genuine reactions provide an authentic assessment of the acts. If they enjoy something, it’s evident, and if they don’t, their boredom is equally apparent.</p><p>Simon proudly revealed that his son has decided to audition for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britain’s Got Talent</a>. Eric’s dream? To be a part of a rock band, with a special fondness for the music of Green Day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Cowell couldn’t help but crack a smile as he acknowledged that this new adventure of fatherhood might be his most challenging yet. After all, his son isn’t just aspiring to sing, he plans to rock out while playing the drums simultaneously. The thought seemed to elicit a humorous “Oh God, no” from Cowell, but it’s clear that he admires his son’s determination and passion for the performing arts.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Cowell expressed his belief in Eric’s seriousness about the endeavor. He speculated that perhaps Eric’s motivation stems from watching other talented kids audition and feeling the desire to share the stage with his friends. Simon’s face lit up as he pondered the possibility of seeing Eric on the BGT stage within the next decade.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-simon-cowell-hopes-his-son-never-comes-to-america-s-got-talent>Simon Cowell Hopes His Son Never Comes to America’s Got Talent</h2><p>Just a month ago, Simon expressed his pride in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric’s</a> drumming skills and the hope that his son would “never” become a contestant on the show. This seemingly contradictory sentiment underscores the complex emotions parents experience when their children embark on artistic journeys.</p><p>Cowell’s interview revealed the unique blend of pride and protectiveness that many parents feel when their children display extraordinary talents. He described Eric’s drumming abilities as impressive, praising his rhythm and timing.</p><p>However, the idea of Eric taking the stage as a performer seemed to stir a mixture of emotions in Simon. He playfully groaned at the thought and admitted that, if they did perform together, he’d likely stay in the wings, allowing his son to take the spotlight.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_SashaFarber_Disney_Christopher-Willard-220x147.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ Fans Are “Shocked” That Sasha Farber Won’t Be Part of This Year’s Live Tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculqmarn6N6pr7InGSmmalirrG8xJqpZqeeYsGpsYynnLGsXaiys7XErGSonl2Xv6rAwKKlrGWXpMFuwMClnKesXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
