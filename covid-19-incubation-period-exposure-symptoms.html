Now you’re left to wonder if you, too, will get sick in the coming days.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But when should you expect symptoms to start if you do get sick? The answer has changed from the earliest days of COVID-19, experts say.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In the beginning of the pandemic, we were really looking at seven to 10 days as the window of time where people had to quarantine or isolate after an exposure,” says Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. “That has shortened significantly now.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How long does it take to develop COVID-19 symptoms?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An incubation period is the length of time it takes someone to develop symptoms after exposure to a pathogen. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has shortened considerably since the virus first began circulating, recent data suggest. Incubation periods averaged about five days when the Alpha variant was dominant, about 4.5 days when Beta and Delta were dominant, and about 3.4 days once Omicron took over, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2022 research review</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Newer research from various countries, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">France</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore</a>, also suggests <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Omicron</a> strains have incubation periods of about three days, or even a little less.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The virus' incubation period is likely shrinking for a few reasons, says Shane Crotty, chief scientific officer at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. The virus has evolved over time, becoming faster and more adept at infecting humans, Crotty says. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nearly everyone has also now had at least one brush with COVID-19</a>, whether through vaccination or illness. Each encounter leaves behind instructions for the immune system, helping it recognize the virus faster the next time it appears.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You having symptoms is all about your immune system being activated,” Crotty explains. “The whole pre-symptomatic period is bad news because your immune system has not managed to pull the fire alarm yet.” A shorter incubation period means that your body is “recognizing the virus faster and pulling those sprinkler systems faster.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When should I test for COVID-19 after an exposure, and when am I in the clear?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Federal health authorities, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recommend testing no sooner than five days</a> after a COVID-19 exposure, unless you develop symptoms earlier. But since current variants seem to have incubation periods of around three days, Pekosz says it's appropriate to test as soon as day three, again unless symptoms start earlier.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, says he starts to feel more confident he's dodged an infection if he’s still feeling healthy three days after a potential exposure. But, "remember, incubation periods are statistical probabilities,” he says. “There’s always going to be outliers.” You could develop a sore throat or runny nose only a couple days after exposure to the virus, or you might not feel sick until day five—or, if you’re lucky, you may not get infected at all.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The timing of symptom onset depends on lots of factors, including the amount of virus to which someone was exposed, Hotez says. Their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">level of pre-existing immunity</a> may also affect the likelihood or timing of getting sick, Crotty adds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Given all this variation, Pekosz recommends monitoring your health for up to a week after an exposure and wearing a mask around other people during that time. Remember, too, that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">false negatives are possible on at-home tests</a>. If you get a negative result, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends</a> taking at least one more test 48 hours later to confirm it.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What is the incubation period of JN.1?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s too soon to know exactly, but Hotez says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JN.1</a> is likely to have an incubation period similar to that of other Omicron strains. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One 2023 study</a> found that while incubation periods have gotten shorter over time, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">various Omicron subvariants</a>’ have all been similar to one another.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In general, Crotty says, there’s a limit to how low incubation periods can go. The SARS-CoV-2 virus works by invading human cells and using them to make numerous copies of itself. SARS-CoV-2 has a long genome that takes a while to copy, so Crotty doubts its incubation period will get much shorter than it already has. Viruses like measles and varicella (which causes chickenpox) on average take longer than a week to incubate, so, by comparison, a three-day incubation period is already pretty fast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVof3R%2Bjpymr6GUYn56ecinmq6akam2sLqMqZyroZ%2BZeqbEz6iqrqqVYsC6uc%2BtpqarXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
