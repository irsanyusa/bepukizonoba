Three in ten (28%) say they don’t often feel tired upon waking, while just 2% say they’re never tired in the morning.</p><p>Three-quarters (76%) of British women say they very often or fairly often wake up feeling tired, compared to six in ten (59%) men.</p><p>Britons under 40 are most likely to report they very often feel tired in the morning (38-41%) compared to 32% of 40-59-year-olds and just 18% of those 60 and above.</p><p>Three quarters (76%) of night owls say they very often or fairly often wake up feeling tired, compared to 57% of early birds.</p><h3>How hard is it to get out of bed in the morning?</h3><p>Despite the fact that the majority of people often wake up feeling tired, over half (55%) of Britons say it’s very or fairly easy for them to get out of bed in the morning. Four in ten (42%) say it’s difficult, with this being more the case for women (49%) than men (35%).</p><p>Our results also show that Britons under the age of 40 (55-58%) are more likely to say they struggle to get up than those in their 40s and 50s (41%) and those aged 60 and above (26%).</p><p>Six in ten (59%) night owls say it’s difficult for them to get out of bed in the morning, compared to one in five (19%) early risers.</p><h3>Do you tend to hit the snooze button before you get up?</h3><p>Four out of ten Britons (40%) say they hit the snooze button at least once in the morning before getting out of bed, including one in seven (15%) who do so once, 13% who do so twice, and 12% who do so three times or more.</p><p>Women are more likely than men (15% vs 8%) to hit the snooze button three times or more in the morning.</p><p>A third of Britons (36%) never hit the snooze button, while 22% say they don’t set an alarm at all.</p><h3>When you wake up in the morning, do you get up straight away or spend some time in bed?</h3><p>Seven in ten (68%) Britons prefer to spend some time in bed in the morning once they wake up. A third (37%) spend up to 10 minutes, 14% spend 10-20 minutes and 9% spend 20-30 minutes in bed after waking up. One in 12 (8%) spend more than half an hour in bed before they get up in the morning.</p><p>A quarter (27%) of 16-24-year-olds prefer to spend more than 20 minutes in bed in the morning, which is higher than across other age groups (13-19%). Young men are more likely than young women to loiter under the covers, at 31% vs 24%.</p><p>One in three Britons (28%) say they get up immediately once they wake up, with this applying notably more to men (32%) than women (24%). Britons aged 40-59 (37%) are most likely to get up straight away compared to 11% of 16-24-year-olds and 22% of 25-39-year-olds. Among those 60 and above, three in ten (31%) say they get up straight away.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtktaaty62faJmiqbakuMSsZm1qaWmGbsXOrp6orl2ouaaxz2aqra2UrnqxrdGtZKyhqGLEorfIp55mpZ%2Bnu6q6xg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
