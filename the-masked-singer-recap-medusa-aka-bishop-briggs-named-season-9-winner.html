Medusa has performed more than anyone else in the competition this season, having returned as a wildcard in the Quarterfinals.</p><p>At the end of the night, the panel and audience voted Medusa as the Season 9 winner. Before she was unmasked, the panel shared their final thoughts about her identity. Guesses included Grimes, Fergie, and Susan Boyle (yes, that was Ken Jeong).</p><p>However, only Nicole Scherzinger correctly guessed that Medusa was Bishop Briggs. The singer expressed how much competing on the show meant to her, and shared her delight at being able to sing an “emo anthem” for her final episode. She closed the show with a performance of her popular song “River.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER,’ ‘I CAN SEE YOUR VOICE’ RENEWED FOR ANOTHER SEASON</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-macaw-unmasked-as-david-archuleta>Macaw Unmasked as David Archuleta</h3><p>Medusa was up against Macaw in the season finale. During Wednesday’s show, Macaw performed “Hold Back the River” by James Bay and “All By Myself” by Eric Carmen. The judges were wowed by his talent, and it was clear they had a hard time deciding who should win.</p><p>Macaw ended up finishing the competition in second place. Guesses from the panel about his identify included Jason Mraz and Neil Patrick Harris. However, Nicole Scherzinger once again correctly guessed that it was David Archuleta, and Ken Jeong agreed with her.</p><p>Jeong got emotional as he shared how much Archuleta meant to him, as he would watch him on American Idol when his wife was pregnant and on bed rest. Archuleta himself also teared up as he talked about his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult journey to coming out</a>. He went on to perform “What Makes You Beautiful” by One Direction.</p><p>And that’s a wrap on The Masked Singer Season 9.
