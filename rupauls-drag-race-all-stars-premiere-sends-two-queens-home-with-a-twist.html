Two queens were sent packing, but something tells us they won’t be gone for long. RuPaul always has some huge twists up her sleeve.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars-introduces-14th-queen-during-premiere-on-paramount>‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars’ Introduces 14th Queen During Premiere on Paramount+</h2><p>The 13 queens competing on this season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars all looked fabulous during their entrances. In the words of Pandora Boxx, “Everybody looks gorgeous, f*ck everybody.” At the beginning of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first episode, </a>RuPaul teased <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a major twist</a> for the season. She said that it is going to be a “game within a game.” The queens and the viewers were left in the dark about any further details.</p><p>Everyone was shook to the core when RuPaul <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped another serious bomb on the queens.</a> A 14th queen would be joining the competition. Fans at home were probably confused as to who it would be. Finally, Miss Piggy popped up on the screen and we were all able to breathe a huge sigh of relief.</p><p>The Queen of The Muppets was able to fulfill her dream of being on RuPaul’s Drag Race after all of these years. She helped judge the Reading Challenge. It is basically a challenge made for Ginger Minj to win because roasting people is what she does best. That’s exactly what ended up happening before RuPaul announced that the Maxi Challenge for the week would be an All Stars Variety Show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trinity-k-bonet-and-serena-chacha-crumble-during-the-all-stars-variety-show>Trinity K.&nbsp;Bonet and Serena ChaCha Crumble During the All Stars Variety Show</h2><p>Miss Piggy popped up on a screen again before the runway because she was jealous about Michelle Visage being RuPaul’s best friend. Honestly, we’re all jealous that Michelle gets to be RuPaul’s best friend. During the All Stars Variety Show, Jan performed a song mocking her elimination and the infamous Madonna challenge. Ra’Jah O’Hara sewed a dress in 60 seconds.</p><p>The biggest disappointment of the episode was when Trinity K.&nbsp;Bonet absolutely bombed a stand-up comedy routine.&nbsp;Serena ChaCha also fell flat with a routine inspired by her love for wig design. Yara Sofia was named the winner of the challenge after shaking her chest up and down the runway in a chaotic performance.</p><p>Yara had to lip-sync against a lip-sync assassin from a past season to earn the power of sending one of the bottom queens home. Coco Montrese was revealed as the lip-sync assassin. Coco and Yara faced off in a lip-sync of “Uptown Funk.” Coco appeared not to know the words but somehow ended up winning. She revealed that the group of queens decided to send Serena home.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ra-jah-o-hara-surprises-the-haters-with-three-incredible-fashion-looks>Ra’Jah O’Hara Surprises the Haters with Three Incredible Fashion Looks</h2><p>In the next Maxi Challenge, the queens were challenged to present three looks for a blue-themed ball. The last of the three looks had to be handmade in the workroom. Jiggly Caliente was the obvious underdog coming into this challenge. Back in her first season, she had two sewing challenges with some very rough looks. One look even went down in history for making her look like a “baked potato.” It’s been 8 years since she was last on the show. Unfortunately, her sewing skills have not improved.</p><p>Jiggly literally wore a blanket with rhinestones on it on the runway. This challenge was basically set up to be Jiggly’s demise. She landed in the bottom two with Yara who was in tears over her low placement in this challenge. Things change so quickly on the show. A queen could be dominating the competition one week and in danger the next week.</p><p>Ra’Jah, a queen who received a lot of hate after competing the first time around, was named the top all star of the week.&nbsp;She turned out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three amazing looks</a> that were all unique in their own way. Ra’Jah is definitely looking for redemption on RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars and is finally getting love from fans on social media. She faced off in a lip-sync against The Queen of the North, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brooke Lynne Heights.</a> The lip-sync ended in a tie and rightfully so. It was EPIC!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Ra’Jah earned a massive cash tip of $20,000. Because both of them won the lip-sync, both Brooke and Ra’Jah had to reveal which queen was voted out of the competition. Ra’Jah chose to eliminate Jiggly. Brooke revealed that the group also collectively decided to eliminate Jiggly. Jiggly was the only one eliminated which means Yara gets to continue to shake her goodies in the competition.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-big-twist-of-the-season>What is the Big Twist of the Season?</h2><p>In true RuPaul fashion, the competition isn’t over yet for Serena and Jiggly. As they were both packing their stuff in their respective episodes, RuPaul popped up on the workroom screen. She reminded them once again that it is a “game within a game.” Viewers are still left questioning exactly what that means.</p><p>In the third season of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, the eliminated queens had the chance to battle their way back into the competition. It was Morgan McMichaels who got to return to the show for a second chance. It’s not clear yet if this same exact twist will be happening this season but it would not be wrong to assume it’s a similar format. RuPaul will definitely be revealing more details as the episodes go on.</p><p>Were you shocked by any of the eliminations or the challenges in the first two episodes of the season?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NUP_193480_8097-1.jpg alt="Gangstagrass Fuses Bluegrass and Hip-Hop During ‘America’s Got Talent’ Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6nmq2cqHqlvsCgZKuZk5p6orjLZqqtmaKoerG%2BxKagnqqVYsCmusOsZK2vn2K%2BtrHEp6pmoJ%2Bism7DyK2fZpldqcSqv9No</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
