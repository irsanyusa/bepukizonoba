Before he died, I hadn't seen him for seven months because he was on location [and] I was in Law School.</p><p>In fact, he died a day before I started my bar exams. I was in Victoria Island here in Lagos and I think I heard [about his death] the next day.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Someone who didn't know that I hadn't heard just said, "sorry about your dad,' and I was like, "what happened?' So I think he got to know that I didn't know, and he was like, "sorry, I was just playing."</p><p>It was a&nbsp; Sunday and my bar finals started that Monday. It was tough, but I really missed having my dad because I could just call him then and gist. He was a friend, so I miss the friendship.</p><p><strong>On family receiving royalties after actor's death</strong></p><p>No, this is Naija. [There's] no such thing. But what we still get is people always remembering him and that's enough for us - to know that people actually still appreciate him, even several years after his death.</p><p><strong>One thing people don't know about the late actor</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>My dad didn't name me Omoruyi, he actually named me Buhari, after [the then] <strong>General Muhammadu Buhari. </strong>But I am not Buhari, before you people start chasing me on the streets.</p><p>My dad was also a historian and he also lectured in the University of Ibadan in the early 80s.</p><p>On the impact of following his dad to movie sets</p><p>I was with him for<strong> "Police Recruits,"</strong> "<strong>Atinga"</strong> and any other movie that was shot in Enugu at that time. After my WASSCE, my dad actually registered me with Actors Guild of Nigeria. So I had a brief hint until I got admission into the Ambrose Ali university. I think that was the end of it.</p><p>When I started there, it was getting very addictive because anytime you're not around there [on set], it's as if 'mehn, movies are being shot and you're not there.' But my dad would always say 'no, you have to go to school first, after that you can decide.'</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But after studying law, I felt like there was no time for that [acting]. It would feel like starting a new career, so I just embraced Law and it has been good since then.</p><p><strong>The support from Nollywood after father's death</strong></p><p>At the beginning, yes [there was the support]. But of course, you know when time passes everybody moves on. It's just a basic fact of life [and] you get to understand it.</p><p>People move on with their own lives and all.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Sam Loco's closest friends in the industry</strong></p><p>His closest friends that I met personally, I would say Lasa Amoro. There's also<strong> Uchenna Amuta</strong> - <strong>Natty - </strong>from the <strong>"New Masquerade" </strong>series.</p><p>Also, <a href=# id=b8fd638e-e764-57bf-abdb-eb73224d7acb>Tom Njemanze from "Died Wretched</a><strong>."</strong> My dad used to call him Died Wretched. To an extent, I still keep in touch with some of them, the ones that are still there. Once in a while, we call.</p><p><strong>Coping after Sam Loco's death</strong></p><p>Sometimes we miss him, but what I am happy about is that he brought forth strong children. Over time, we began to cope and it has been good without him.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It would have been nicer for him to be here, but even without him, we move on.</p><p><strong>Greatest lesson&nbsp;and advice received from the late actor</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;greatest lesson I learnt from my dad is to go after what I want, even when people are not helping.</p><p>He wasn't one to help you with anything. For instance, if you're looking for a job and the Managing Director is his friend, he wasn't one to call him for help.</p><p>He believed that if you merit it, you get it. So from that, I learnt a lot and it has helped me in life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>My dad wouldn't sit you down to advise you, but overtime, with what he says, you would learn. The greatest advice I would say he gave me was to actually make sure that every decision you make, you're ready to live with the consequences.</p><p>For example, there was a time in Enugu. Popsy and I were staying in the same hotel. A friend of mine - a lady - came to see me. I didn't even know he was downstairs by the swimming pool and when I was escorting her, I saw him.</p><p>When I got back, he was like 'if you give girl belly, na you know. I no go pay any pikin school fees.' Basically, he taught us to stay with the consequences of our actions.</p><p><strong>What Omoruyi Efe's has been up to</strong></p><p>I have been facing my career. Right now, I am a partner in a law firm - Graceville Chambers in Ikeja -&nbsp;with some of my friends from school.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>On ever going into filmmaking</strong></p><p>If I ever went back to Nollywood, it would be to produce because I have a knack for quality and not a lot of Nollywood movies that I watch...</p><p>I have a knack for excellence and perhaps, in future, when I am very tight, I want to create the best movie that has even been seen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8tK3MZqOom59isqexjKymp2Wjna6zsdJmaGasmJ67qHnPnqappJVisbC602aip6enYq6ju9StZKWZpJp6oq%2FTqKlmm5ykwKa%2F02adq6GVo7G0ecinZp6jYp23q8Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
