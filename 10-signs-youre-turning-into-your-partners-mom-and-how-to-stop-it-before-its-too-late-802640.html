But sometimes, a&nbsp;woman’s desire to&nbsp;take everything under her warm “wing” becomes a&nbsp;serious <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>obstacle</a> for a&nbsp;healthy relationship, and the partnership of&nbsp;marriage starts to&nbsp;resemble a&nbsp;parent-child scenario.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>,<strong> </strong>we&nbsp;did an&nbsp;investigation and discovered that some of&nbsp;us do&nbsp;act like moms to&nbsp;our partners. Let’s take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the “red flags” together and find out how we&nbsp;can switch the roles from being a&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;being a&nbsp;partner again if&nbsp;some of&nbsp;these signs occur in&nbsp;your relationship.</p><p><h2>1. You constantly nag.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/83e/c0d/d9e4d05e8eaa2e392d4d971995.jpg><p>Women are more inclined to&nbsp;nag than men, psychologists <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>say</a>. You may want to&nbsp;take control of&nbsp;your relationship without even realizing&nbsp;it, and by&nbsp;nagging, you demonstrate that you’re a&nbsp;loving and caring partner, and you’re always <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>right</a>. If&nbsp;you continuously direct your partner, and if&nbsp;your instructions aren’t met, then it’s likely that your husband will perceive this as&nbsp;nagging.</p><p>The simplest way to&nbsp;deal with it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;put yourself in&nbsp;your partner’s shoes and ask yourself if&nbsp;you would tolerate your partner’s constant <a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> if&nbsp;the roles were reversed. Thinking about it&nbsp;this way could <a href=# title=motivate data-link=tag>motivate</a> you to&nbsp;use praise and appreciation more than criticism.</p><p><h2>2. You help with their career aspirations too much.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d7/97c/bcd19657dca5d2f3901782662f.jpg><p>You write his cover letter and resume, actively search and apply for jobs for him, and ask everyone in&nbsp;your network to&nbsp;give him a&nbsp;chance. The best way to&nbsp;deal with this is&nbsp;to&nbsp;let yourself feel the discomfort of&nbsp;<strong>not doing anything </strong>and allow him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;responsible for his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> himself.</p><p>You could research and send him information on&nbsp;training that could help him beef up&nbsp;his skills. But it’s better to&nbsp;let your partner decide whether they choose a&nbsp;certain job or&nbsp;not.</p><p><h2>3. You always clean up&nbsp;after them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b1/ab9/13fa30558d9d3db7641bc91a97.jpg><p>“He’s too tired after work so&nbsp;I’ll wash the dishes, it’s not a&nbsp;big deal for&nbsp;me.” Does this happen often in&nbsp;your <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>? If&nbsp;you often get into the habit of&nbsp;being the only person to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;after the whole family, it’s time to&nbsp;change things a&nbsp;little bit.</p><p>Scheduled cleaning will help to&nbsp;arrange things better and make everyone take part in&nbsp;domestic routines.</p><p><h2>4. You meddle in&nbsp;their relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f6/4ed/b345e75d9899ffd330b6ba1c6a.jpg><p>You may think that some of&nbsp;his friends are a&nbsp;bad influence and have told him not to&nbsp;hang out with them. Or&nbsp;you may constantly remind him to&nbsp;call his best friend or&nbsp;parent or&nbsp;sibling even though he’s told you he&nbsp;doesn’t feel the need to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;them.</p><p>You may not feel comfortable seeing him keep toxic friends and lose connections with good friends or&nbsp;family. However, you have to&nbsp;let him cope with his own relationships.</p><p>You can offer your advice when asked but it’s not your responsibility to&nbsp;fix things. Also, what you think needs “fixing” might not be&nbsp;what he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fixed.</p><p><h2>5. You do&nbsp;all the cooking and grocery shopping.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/070/ba5/62720657b4be0716599dfa18c8.jpg><p>“I’d better do&nbsp;the shopping myself because my&nbsp;spouse will buy the wrong thing,” or&nbsp;“I’ll cook myself, even if&nbsp;I’m tired because if&nbsp;he&nbsp;cooks, I&nbsp;will have to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;all that mess that he’ll leave after cooking.” If&nbsp;these statements come to&nbsp;your mind too often, then your over-functioning in&nbsp;the relationship again.</p><p>You can do&nbsp;your grocery shopping together, and ask them to&nbsp;carry heavy bags to&nbsp;the car. You can give them more freedom by&nbsp;asking them what they’d like to&nbsp;buy, and if&nbsp;they’d like some other brand of&nbsp;milk or&nbsp;sauce. Let them make these decisions on&nbsp;their own. Nothing bad will happen if&nbsp;you lose your grip over domestic things, where everyone has their own duties.</p><p><h2>6. You always try to&nbsp;dress them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/308/b73/9a06a15ebda6070f15383a75c9.jpg><p>Sometimes a&nbsp;woman treats her partner like her personal makeover project, forcing them to&nbsp;look a&nbsp;certain way and to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;style that she considers modern and appealing. It’s totally fine to&nbsp;buy clothes for your husband. But if&nbsp;he&nbsp;ends up&nbsp;never wearing them or&nbsp;only wearing them because you insisted, what’s the point? It&nbsp;becomes more about money <strong>being spent poorly</strong>.</p><p>If&nbsp;he&nbsp;starts dressing inappropriately, looks untidy all the time, and/or doesn’t take care of&nbsp;his personal hygiene, it’s his responsibility to&nbsp;change.</p><p><h2>7. You’re in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;their calendar.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a45/f85/4ed2a156e99d23869192f029d5.jpg><p>When we&nbsp;think about our partner’s duties, we&nbsp;sometimes tend to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things to&nbsp;make sure they actually do&nbsp;them. We&nbsp;worry that they won’t keep up&nbsp;with their schedule so&nbsp;we&nbsp;take over and spoonfeed them without anyone even realizing&nbsp;it.</p><p>When you constantly try to&nbsp;“help” him, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t keep to&nbsp;his schedule, you’re going to&nbsp;blame yourself for something you weren’t responsible for in&nbsp;the first place. Just let them screw&nbsp;up. The disappointment he&nbsp;may feel afterward can serve as&nbsp;motivation for them to&nbsp;develop their own approach to&nbsp;how to&nbsp;prevent it&nbsp;from happening again.</p><p><h2>8. They don’t give back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/262/e2991552729535d530eed3f915.jpg><p>You spent the whole day at&nbsp;work or&nbsp;with kids, cooked a&nbsp;delicious meal, and prepared a&nbsp;small treat for your beloved. But they took it&nbsp;for granted and never thought of&nbsp;doing something kind in&nbsp;return. You put forth too much sacrifice and placed their needs over your own, just like a&nbsp;real mom would do&nbsp;toward her children.</p><p>Splitting responsibilities and doing something nice for both of&nbsp;you together may help. While doing something together, you both are interested in&nbsp;the result, whether it’s a&nbsp;tasty family dinner or&nbsp;a&nbsp;short road trip to&nbsp;the seaside to&nbsp;help you both take a&nbsp;break from the burden of&nbsp;everyday chores.</p><p><h2>9. They have too many requests for you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5bc/3a5/0ae2a05fd1be6fcd1c1afd01e0.jpg><p>As&nbsp;they get used to&nbsp;your over-devotion, your partner may start abusing your wish to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things on&nbsp;your own. They keep coming to&nbsp;you with small requests that literally devour your time and effort. You’re sleeping and they need that shirt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ironed immediately, so&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;doing it&nbsp;themselves, they will come and wake you&nbsp;up, asking for help.</p><p>One way or&nbsp;another, you need to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;say “no,” giving them more freedom and handing over more responsibility to&nbsp;your partner. Instead of&nbsp;being ready to&nbsp;give advice on&nbsp;any subject, you may just say, “I&nbsp;don’t know,” and there’s nothing wrong with that.</p><p><h2>10. You take responsibility for their actions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ce/bb1/3219365aa5a49c0dbb304af06f.jpg><p>They didn’t pay a&nbsp;bill on&nbsp;time, so&nbsp;you take on&nbsp;the responsibility and settle things yourself. Or&nbsp;you may fix too many problems that are a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;your partner’s negligence or&nbsp;absent-mindedness. This all makes you stressed out, and you may often spend time dealing with the consequences of&nbsp;your partner’s poor organization and time management.</p><p>It’s time to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;go&nbsp;and let them learn from their own mistakes. You may want to&nbsp;remember that you’re not Superwoman who will come to&nbsp;the rescue each time. No&nbsp;one will die if&nbsp;your partner deals with the issues on&nbsp;their own.</p><p>What are some things you can’t help but do&nbsp;for your spouse?
