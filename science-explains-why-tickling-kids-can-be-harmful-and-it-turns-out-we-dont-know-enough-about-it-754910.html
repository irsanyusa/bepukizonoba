While many among&nbsp;us would frown upon suggesting this, a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> shows that only&nbsp;32% of&nbsp;respondents reported enjoying being tickled, with&nbsp;32% giving neutral responses, and&nbsp;36% saying that they disliked&nbsp;it. We’ve all been tickled from time to&nbsp;time as&nbsp;children, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;assume it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;normal. But remember that back in&nbsp;those days, not wearing a&nbsp;seat belt also used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;normal!</p><p>Analyzing various research conducted on&nbsp;this topic, <strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;explain why you should skip tickling and find another way to&nbsp;have fun&nbsp;— perhaps sharing a&nbsp;joke or&nbsp;playing together is&nbsp;a&nbsp;better idea.</p><p><h2>Just because a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;giggling doesn’t mean they’re enjoying being tickled.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/146/34f/05e67b5c4ca95859ef037854f5.jpg><p>Kids, especially ticklish ones, can’t stop laughing when being tickled, even if&nbsp;they absolutely hate&nbsp;it. This reflexive laughter gives parents the illusion that the child is&nbsp;actually enjoying it&nbsp;when they’re really not. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>study</a> conducted at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;California in&nbsp;1997, scientists found that tickling doesn’t create the same happy feelings that are created when a&nbsp;person laughs at&nbsp;a&nbsp;funny joke. <strong>Tickling just creates </strong>an&nbsp;outward<strong> illusion that a&nbsp;person is&nbsp;laughing</strong>.</p><p><h2>Tickling is&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;assert dominance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/066/a95/b7243e5debba794f69d8a140c5.jpg><p>A&nbsp;<strong>person being tickled loses self-control</strong>. The struggle to&nbsp;gain control can be&nbsp;humiliating for the child and can leave unpleasant memories for a&nbsp;lifetime. When adults tickle kids, they mostly mean to&nbsp;have fun, but that doesn’t mean the outcome won’t be&nbsp;harmful.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Dr. Richard <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexander</a>, a&nbsp;professor of&nbsp;evolutionary biology at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Michigan, tickling can very well be&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;dominance, and the laughing that follows is&nbsp;an&nbsp;evolutionary way of&nbsp;showing submissiveness.</p><p><h2>Tickling has been used to&nbsp;torture people for ages.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8b/243/b4a4d75e208b4260e7569e1679.jpg><p>Tickling has long since been used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;torture. During the <a href=#>Han</a> Dynasty in&nbsp;China, tickling was a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;torturing nobility as&nbsp;it&nbsp;left no&nbsp;marks and the victim could recover relatively easily and quickly. It&nbsp;was also popular in&nbsp;Japan where they even coined a&nbsp;special word for&nbsp;it: kusuguri-zeme, which means “merciless tickling”.</p><p>Vernon R. <a href=#>Wiehe</a> from the University of&nbsp;Kentucky studied 150 adults who were abused by&nbsp;their siblings during childhood. <strong>Many </strong>of&nbsp;the study subjects<strong> reported tickling as&nbsp;a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;physical abuse</strong>. The study concluded that tickling can provoke extreme physiological reactions in&nbsp;the victim such as&nbsp;vomiting and loss of&nbsp;consciousness due to&nbsp;the inability to&nbsp;breathe.</p><p><h2>The child may not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell you to&nbsp;stop.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/561/84c/200e8e511187a75fff4bd4723e.jpg><p>Tickling can cause fits of&nbsp;uncontrollable laughter that are hard to&nbsp;stop. Laughter caused by&nbsp;continuous tickling can reach a&nbsp;point where the<strong> person being tickled can no&nbsp;longer breath properly, nor can they say that they’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficult situation</strong>. Something that started off as&nbsp;“fun” could cause serious medical complications. And why have fun tickling when there are so&nbsp;many better ways to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;good time together?</p><p><h2>Tickling may cause lifelong trust issues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc0/04e/0fd1cd522a9c794b0d0abc4a4d.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dr. </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alexander</a>, <strong>tickling someone against their will can actually cause “great mental pain.”</strong> Sometimes this pain can linger for a&nbsp;lifetime.</p><p>Patty Wipfler, a&nbsp;parenting expert and the founder and director of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hand in&nbsp;Hand</a> organization says that from her experience, tickling during childhood is&nbsp;a&nbsp;common cause for emotional challenges, even in&nbsp;adults. She writes, “In&nbsp;my&nbsp;many years of&nbsp;listening to&nbsp;adults talk about the emotional challenges of&nbsp;their lives as&nbsp;children, tickling comes up&nbsp;again and again as&nbsp;an&nbsp;experience that has been hurtful.” She says the <a href=# title=trauma data-link=tag>trauma</a> can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation where the person affected can’t relax when others are in&nbsp;close proximity to&nbsp;them, they feel insecure even while sleeping close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted partner, and are internally on&nbsp;guard any time there’s more than casual touching between them and someone they love.</p><p><h2>There are better ways to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;love you” to&nbsp;your baby.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fb/bba/6662fd50fe9c2ba4d8405e6a42.jpg><p>Parents generally think that they know what’s good for their child, and from their experience, they feel that tickling is&nbsp;normal. However, given the various pitfalls of&nbsp;tickling and knowing the fact that there are better ways to&nbsp;bond, it’s better to&nbsp;avoid the tickling route. And if&nbsp;for some reason you wish to&nbsp;tickle, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;advisable to&nbsp;seek permission from the child. Parents should always ask before touching the child or&nbsp;making decisions that affect their body. What are some other ways to&nbsp;have fun and bond with a&nbsp;child? Well, a&nbsp;simple Google search will yield many answers.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about tickling? Did you enjoy it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child?
