On&nbsp;the one hand, it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hopelessly outdated. But on&nbsp;the other hand, it&nbsp;can instill in&nbsp;us high ideals, which supposedly no&nbsp;longer exist in&nbsp;modern literature. The writers that create in&nbsp;modern times are blamed for superficial plots, implausible relationships, shallow dialogue, and so&nbsp;on. The problem is&nbsp;that these allegations are based on&nbsp;the books everyone knows, like Fifty Shades of&nbsp;Grey, Twilight, The Hunger Games, and other bestsellers. But modern literature is&nbsp;not limited to&nbsp;these books exclusively.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;figure out whether or&nbsp;not classic literature really does deserve reverence and modern literature, contempt.</p><p><h2>Classic literature doesn’t provide a&nbsp;modern person with what they need.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39e/431/6a76045f5cb708ced920a7934d.jpg><p>With rare exceptions, we, our parents, and our children have studied the same literary works at&nbsp;school. Meanwhile, times are changing&nbsp;— now people’s interests are different from the ones people had several decades ago. The classics begin to&nbsp;seem boring because we&nbsp;<a href=#>don’t know</a> the realities described in&nbsp;them. Sometimes it’s difficult for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;understand what’s at&nbsp;stake since we&nbsp;don’t have such experience. However, modern literature describes the reality we&nbsp;live&nbsp;in, which is&nbsp;why many people choose to&nbsp;read&nbsp;it.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, there are eternal themes, like the relationship between parents and children, romance, patriotism, love of&nbsp;nature, animals, and so&nbsp;on. However, even these things change. We&nbsp;don’t address our parents as&nbsp;“sir” or&nbsp;“madam,” we&nbsp;don’t sing serenades under windows, and cats and dogs have become our family members. We&nbsp;really can’t find any of&nbsp;these things in&nbsp;classic literature.</p><p><h2>Women are the main buyers of&nbsp;books. The target audience for classics was men.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/632/c88/56095a52a5a43f637bab45dfc0.jpg><p>Women are believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the main readers of&nbsp;fiction. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>statistics</a>, men prefer popular science genres and read <a href=#>less</a> in&nbsp;general. The reason for this is&nbsp;the different attitudes toward literature between men and women. For example, women perceive books as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;escape from reality, while men read them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;manual for furniture assembling, for example.</p><p>Since books tend to&nbsp;inspire and support&nbsp;us, it’s not surprising that many people prefer modern literature over the classics:</p><ul><li>The main character in&nbsp;classic novels is&nbsp;usually a&nbsp;man.</li><li>Even if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;woman, she’s <a href=#>portrayed</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man and depends on&nbsp;him for everything.</li><li>There are practically no&nbsp;strong female characters in&nbsp;classic pieces.</li></ul><p>It’s quite difficult to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;these classic stories as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;advice, monitoring, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;escape reality. Modern books, on&nbsp;the contrary, offer&nbsp;us an&nbsp;abundance of&nbsp;strong female characters, like the dystopian novel, The Handmaid’s Tale by&nbsp;Margaret Atwood or&nbsp;Zuleikha by&nbsp;Guzel Yakhina (which, by&nbsp;the way, has also been <a href=#>filmed</a>).</p><p><h2>Classic novels and stories are usually written in&nbsp;a&nbsp;complicated language while modern texts are quite simple as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0db/d9e/8cadf0541f893c99359461cefc.jpg><p>On&nbsp;one hand, the language of&nbsp;classic literature is&nbsp;very difficult. Remember the sentences in&nbsp;Leo Tolstoy’s books that were a&nbsp;whole page long?! But these texts are difficult to&nbsp;read for one more reason: they contain many words, the meaning of&nbsp;which we&nbsp;can no&nbsp;longer understand. These are the names of&nbsp;objects and professions that no&nbsp;longer exist and words that were fashionable at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the book’s creation that eventually disappeared.</p><p>For example, a&nbsp;modern person has no&nbsp;idea that a&nbsp;yellow ticket was issued to&nbsp;ladies of&nbsp;the oldest profession in&nbsp;the world, while a&nbsp;bustle was a&nbsp;padded undergarment used to&nbsp;add fullness or&nbsp;support to&nbsp;the backs of&nbsp;women’s dresses.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other <a href=#>hand</a>, the language of&nbsp;the classics is&nbsp;very rich. It’s here that you’ll have a&nbsp;refined syntax, unusual comparisons, and various metaphors that you will almost never find in&nbsp;modern literature. In&nbsp;addition, classic literature is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;replenish your vocabulary, which is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;undeniable advantage. It&nbsp;can even help improve your critical thinking.</p><p><h2>Previously, only people in-the-know could choose the profession of&nbsp;a&nbsp;writer. Nowadays, anyone can become an&nbsp;author.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b68/a01/ab81de51fa953b2f3b61bc3c4a.jpg><p>Currently, you don’t even need to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;publisher to&nbsp;publish your book&nbsp;— everything can be&nbsp;done for the right amount of&nbsp;money. This freedom <a href=#>leads</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;works being published all the time. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence, an&nbsp;unimaginable amount of&nbsp;literature has been introduced to&nbsp;the market, most of&nbsp;which can be&nbsp;easily deemed terrible.</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, many modern writers follow an&nbsp;unspoken rule: you <a href=#>should</a> only write about your own experience. Personal experience is&nbsp;interesting and exciting. But when all books are based on&nbsp;experience, usually including something tragic, like the loss of&nbsp;parents or&nbsp;loved ones; a&nbsp;struggle with various addictions, and so&nbsp;on, you’ll want something fictional, romantic, and versatile. Because no&nbsp;matter what one may say, people’s experiences are more or&nbsp;less similar.</p><p><h2>Wonderful novels are published in&nbsp;modern times too. In&nbsp;the past, there were many bad novels, they’ve just been forgotten.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e58/9ed/44a2fb52c79862a729986cfdec.jpg><p>Is&nbsp;modern literature really as&nbsp;bad as&nbsp;everyone thinks? Actually, it&nbsp;<a href=#>depends</a> on&nbsp;what you read. If&nbsp;among the thousands of&nbsp;novels released this year, you come across 2&nbsp;or 3&nbsp;books of&nbsp;poor content and quality, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that the remaining thousands are the same.</p><p>The problem is&nbsp;that it’s difficult to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;good book among thousands of&nbsp;others. We&nbsp;usually choose a&nbsp;book based on&nbsp;recommendations and reviews in&nbsp;online shops. Unfortunately, these reviews and recommendations are <a href=#>given</a> to&nbsp;books whose authors have taken care of&nbsp;advertising. But there are many great writers who don’t have the money to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this.</p><p>In&nbsp;the past, the book market was, of&nbsp;course, much smaller, but even at&nbsp;that time, there were poor novels and stories. They haven’t stood the test of&nbsp;time and have been forgotten. That’s why it&nbsp;seems that all classic literature is&nbsp;refined and of&nbsp;high quality, while modern literature is&nbsp;not.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you read classic or&nbsp;modern literature?
