So beautiful that she captivated the hearts of both men and even the gods with her ethereal beauty.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-69b92f9a-8782-4090-a7ca-aaff7138c486 data-caption="Medusa had an ethereal beauty [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/yzQktkpTURBXy8wYzk0NWYyZTg3ZTgzNWExYzdlYjRmM2Y4MTgxOTFlZC5qcGeRlQLNAjTNAvrCww></span><p>As one of Athena's devoted worshippers, Medusa pledged to remain chaste until death and she held true to this vow, despite being relentlessly pursued by countless admirers.</p><p>Many men tried to win her heart, but her devotion was to <strong>Athena</strong>, the goddess of wisdom and war. Although Athena saw what was happening with the very beautiful female worshipper in her temple, she chose to remain silent, closely watching Medusa's every move</p><p>Fate took a dark turn when <strong>Poseidon</strong>, the ruler of the seas, laid eyes on Medusa and desired her. On that fateful day, as Medusa visited Athena's temple to worship as usual, Poseidon cunningly approached her with devious intentions but, his advances were firmly rejected. So, he resorted to an act of violence driven by wounded pride.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Confused, desperate and frightened, Medusa cried out for help, calling upon the very goddess she had faithfully served for years. Yet, Athena ignored her, leaving Medusa at the mercy of Poseidon. Being just a helpless human, she stood no chance over a god. Medusa was raped, and her dignity stolen from her.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2a30123c-8010-4794-af0c-d40a12619113 data-caption="Medusa was forced to give up her dignity [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/ZgWktkpTURBXy9kZmI4NjcxMjNlN2E5MmU3ZTNlOWMxM2RlMjg0YjA5OS5qcGeRlQLNATPNAfTCww></span><p>For days, Medusa wept over the terrible violation, but the deed was irrevocable. Enraged at the desecration of her temple and perhaps even a tinge of envy for Medusa's ethereal beauty, Athena placed a cruel curse upon her. She declared that no man would ever gaze upon Medusa's once beautiful face again because she broke her vow of celibacy.</p><p>Athena turned the beautiful Medusa into a hideous creature with serpents for hair.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7e2e7c01-f812-4a49-b7dc-ae81c69412ff data-caption="Medusa was cursed by Athena forever [Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/PeLktkpTURBXy82NWU0ZTk2MzExMDFjZmU2ZWFmMDg1ZTg5MzZmYjVhMC5qcGeRlQLNAdrNArrCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Anyone who met her gaze was instantly turned to stone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMDHnmSgqpWauG652K2fZqeWYrWww4ytn55ln6OwpnnBnpiurJmbwq15zJ6brquRYq%2Bmr8CmnGaZXaiwor7YZqWin5ipuqK%2BxGhom7Cepru6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
