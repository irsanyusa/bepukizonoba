If you’re searching for the best jewelry brands with a masculine bent, we’ve assembled a panel of jewelry and accessory experts to run us through the brands you should look out for, what to keep in mind when choosing your buys, and everything else you could want to know about the best men’s jewelry brands.</p><h2 id=what-to-keep-in-mind-when-buying-mens-jewelry->What to keep in mind when buying men’s jewelry</h2><h3>What is your budget?</h3><p>Jewelry is often an investment, to put it mildly, so you want to be sure you’re paying for the right pieces. “When buying jewelry, men should consider if the piece is more trend-driven or a long-term piece,” advises David Schoenfeld, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ring Bear</a>. “For trendy items, they may want to opt for more accessible [i.e., affordable] materials like silver or brass. However, if it’s a wedding ring or watch they know they’ll enjoy for a long time, it’s worth investing in 14 karat gold or platinum.”</p><h3>What is your lifestyle?</h3><p>When it comes to materials, “Truly, it depends on what you like and when you’re going to wear it,” says Ben Levinson, president of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dynasty Jewelry and Loan</a>. “If you’re a mechanic or a weightlifter, you may want to consider wearing something like a silicone band while doing these activities or jobs and save the gold and other metals for when you’re off the clock. Gold, platinum, and silver can be resized if needed and re-polished to look brand new, while non-precious metals like tungsten cannot be polished or sized, although it is scratch resistant.”</p><h3>Does it need a custom look?</h3><p>“When shopping for jewelry for a special event where the focus is on elevated and standout pieces, consider design elements that can make your jewelry look more luxurious and distinctive, like jewelry with intricate and unique designs,” says Mike McGuire, stylist at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maison Miru</a>. “Pieces that feature detailed craftsmanship, such as filigree work, engraving, or custom designs, often have a more upscale feel. Pay attention to the setting of gemstones: High-quality jewelry often features secure and well-crafted settings that protect the gems and enhance their brilliance.”</p><h3>How long should it last?</h3><p>“Think of the jewelry's lifespan,” says Rustin Yasavolian, CEO at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Masina Diamonds</a>. “Trendy pieces might go out of fashion, but classics stay relevant for decades. Of course, material and craftsmanship will go hand in hand with longevity of the piece, so try not to pick pieces that don’t seem sturdy.” Another factor influencing a piece’s lifespan is how you care for it. <a rel=alternate href=#>How to clean jewelry</a> depends on the materials, but whether you’re dealing with <a rel=alternate href=#>lab-grown diamonds</a> or a gold chain, your approach should be as gentle as possible.</p><h3>What is your personal style?</h3><p>“If you can pull off a bolder look, consider thicker chains, paperclip chains, diamonds, and layering them to create a big look,” says Steven Singer, CEO of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Steven Singer Jewelers</a>. “If you’re looking for an everyday look that’s easily worn to work, on weekends, and out for the night, a classic link chain that is 18-22 inches will always be timeless. It adds a pop of class and style but isn't distracting.”</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-mens-jewelry-brands->Our top picks for the best men’s jewelry brands</h2><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Mejuri</a></h3><p>“For affordable style, the red hot brand Mejuri now has their own men’s line,” says Ty Wilson, co-founder and COO at ring specialists <a rel=nofollow href=#>CustomMade</a>. “They feature some great <a rel=nofollow href=#>affordable signet rings</a>, provided you don’t need the ability to add customization, like a family crest. Their <a rel=nofollow href=#>box chain necklace</a> is perfect for weekend style, and for guys with piercings, their <a rel=nofollow href=#>mini hoop earrings</a> aren’t just for the ladies.”</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$38 - $898</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free for orders over $75</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Free 30-day returns</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>John Hardy</a></h3><p>Lauren Kaminsky Goldman, third generation pawnbroker and creative director of <a rel=nofollow href=#>ByGOLDGIRL</a>, suggests checking out John Hardy for pieces she describes as “everyday classics.” She particularly likes this gold and silver <a rel=nofollow href=#>love knot bracelet</a> (“I love how smooth this piece feels—that and the fact that it’s two-tone makes it super wearable!” she adds), but if that’s too much metal, they also have a range of leather goods, like this <a rel=nofollow href=#>Naga wrap</a> with a silver dragon head clasp.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$175 - $48,000</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 30 days (no returns on custom items)</p><p><h3 class=title>John Hardy</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Vitaly</a></h3><p>“This brand has gained traction for its modern, architectural pieces,” says Yasavolian. “Known for its versatile designs, it appeals to the urban and edgy gentleman.” Yasavolian recommends checking out one of Vitaly’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>pendant necklaces</a>, which come in a range of fun themes and colors, or their <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kusari bracelet</a>, an oversized chain bracelet inspired by snake scales.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$32 - $230</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free for orders over $50</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>30-day return period</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>David Yurman</a></h3><p>“David Yurman is a great option for those leaning into more casual, everyday men’s jewelry,” says Wilson. “Their signature cable design works well with chains, bracelets, and rings. I recommend the <a rel=nofollow href=#>heirloom link necklace</a> and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>black titanium cuff bracelet</a>.” Yasavolian, too, is a fan, adding that, “ A fusion of art and craftsmanship, David Yurman is iconic for its cable bracelet designs and contemporary luxury.”</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$195 - $87,000</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free two-day shipping</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>30-day return period</p><p><h3 class=title>David Yurman</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Eriness</a></h3><p>“Eriness creates amazing fine jewelry, but with the collaboration featuring emerging menswear brand, Yony, they have created the ideal gold chain that is a staple in my rotation,” says Schoenfeld. Schoenfeld referring to the 14 karat, 20-inch <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eriness x Yony essential gold chain</a>, but we’d also advise looking at their many other options, including their <a rel=nofollow href=#>collaboration with Resist</a>.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$95 - $75,000</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>$10</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>All sales are final</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Studebaker Metals</a></h3><p>“This family-owned brand out of the Midwest champions the branding ‘slow is fast,’” says Schoenfeld. “They make great pieces, meant to last, at affordable prices. Their cuffs are up there with anyone’s.” He recommends two of their cuffs, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>plait cuff</a> and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>workshop cuff</a>, both of which are available in either work patina brass or sterling silver, while the latter can also be bought in work patina copper, or a polished version of each.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$42 - $3,548</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free, or $12 for two-day shipping</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 30 days</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Stephen Webster</a></h3><p>“Stephen Webster is a British jewelry designer known for his edgy and contemporary designs,” says McGuire. “His men's jewelry often incorporates unique gemstones and distinctive motifs.” For some beautiful examples of this, check out the <a rel=nofollow href=#>thorn beaded necklace</a>, which mixes either lapis or malachite with black onyx, and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>thorn large oval bracelet</a>, to really set off your spiky personality.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$60 - $31,500</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>$25, or free on orders over $1,000</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 30 days</p><p><h3 class=title>Stephen Webster</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Ōura</a></h3><p>Sure, jewelry that just looks good is fine, but it can also be highly functional these days—-especially if you’re an exercise fanatic. “The newest trend in men’s jewelry is a ring for fitness enthusiasts,” says Wilson. “The <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ōura Ring</a> tracks your workouts and sleep, while also adding some stylish flair.” With a seven-day battery life and research-grade sensors, you maybe shouldn’t admit that you like it more than your wedding ring, but you probably will.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$299 - $549</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>$15</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>30-day return period</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ourahealth.imgix.net/product/wizard/heritage-silver@2x.png alt=Ōura title=Ōura width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Veert</a></h3><p>Schoenfeld is a big fan of Veert, saying, “Their signature emerald green really speaks to me. It’s been cool to watch them enter the category with a distinct point of view and evolve with each collection.” Schoenfeld’s personal picks are the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cuban link malachite, green onyx and freshwater pearl necklace</a>, and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>malachite and green onyx signature ring</a>, both of which show off the brand’s incredible use of color.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$165 - $1,550</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Calculated at checkout</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>No returns or exchanges</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Northskull</a></h3><p>“With a distinct design DNA that's all about intricate detailing, this brand has become a favorite among modern trendsetters,” says Yasavolian. In terms of favorite pieces, Yasavolian points out both the <a rel=nofollow href=#>In 'n' Out necklace</a>, with its aesthetically pleasing tag made up of inverted triangles, and this eclectically assembled black onyx and turquoise <a rel=nofollow href=#>gold atticus macrame bracelet</a>.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$80 - $775</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>$12, free for orders over $200</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 7-10 days, provided product is still in its original packaging</p><p><h3 class=title>Northskull</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Hatton Labs</a></h3><p>Another European option, Hatton Labs is based–—and does all of its designing—in England, while the pieces themselves are made in Italy. “This U.K. brand continues to push the envelope, bringing new styles into the men’s category,” enthuses Schoenfeld. “They’re reimagining traditionally female classics like the <a rel=nofollow href=#>tennis bracelet</a>.” Schoenfeld also urges people to check out their <a rel=nofollow href=#>white mini pearl chain</a>.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$94 - $405</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Via FedEx</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 30 days</p><p><h3 class=title>Hatton Labs</h3></p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Miansai</a></h3><p>“Miansai is known for its minimalist and timeless designs,” says McGuire. “Many of its pieces feature clean lines and simple shapes, making them versatile and suitable for various occasions. This versatility appeals to men who appreciate jewelry they can wear every day and on special occasions.” McGuire advises trying out their <a rel=nofollow href=#>Axel ring</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>hook leather bracelet</a>.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$85 - $5,350</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free on orders over $75</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 30 days</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Craighill</a></h3><p>“This design brand out of Brooklyn makes everyday items better,” says Schoenfeld. “I’ve worn their cuffs for years and I’m on my second keychain.” Schoenfeld’s preferred items are this <a rel=nofollow href=#>radial cuff</a> and this <a rel=nofollow href=#>closed helix keyring</a>, both of which are available in brass, stainless steel, or vapor black.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$8 - $150</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free on orders over $100</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Free returns within 30 days</p><h3><a rel=nofollow href=#>Georg Jensen</a></h3><p>“Georg Jensen's jewelry and accessories are strongly influenced by Danish design principles, which prioritize simplicity, functionality, and elegance,” explains McGuire. “The brand's commitment to clean lines and minimalist aesthetics appeals to men who appreciate understated and timeless style.” See for yourself with McGuire’s picks, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Reflect ID bangle</a> and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>classic cufflinks</a>.</p><h4>Price range</h4><p>$110 - $16,575</p><h4>Shipping</h4><p>Free for Georg Jensen account holders, otherwise, calculated at checkout</p><h4>Return policy</h4><p>Within 14 days</p><p><h3 class=title>Georg Jensen</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-mens-jewelry-brands>How we selected the best men’s jewelry brands</h2><p>To curate our list, we turned to our panel of experts, who bring decades of combined experience in the jewelry business. These experts are Lauren Kaminsky Goldman, third generation pawnbroker and creative director of <a rel=nofollow href=#>ByGOLDGIRL</a>; Ben Levinson, president of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dynasty Jewelry and Loan</a>; Mike McGuire, stylist at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maison Miru</a>; David Schoenfeld, founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ring Bear</a>; Steven Singer, CEO of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Steven Singer Jewelers</a>; Ty Wilson, co-founder and COO at ring specialists <a rel=nofollow href=#>CustomMade</a>; and Rustin Yasavolian, CEO at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Masina Diamonds</a>.</p><h2 id=where-to-buy-mens-jewelry>Where to buy men’s jewelry</h2><p>“For a long time, the only real approach to buying jewelry was to go to your local jeweler,” says Wilson. “Those stores are overwhelmingly focused on engagement rings and jewelry for women, with a small section dedicated to men’s jewelry and watches. Now more than ever, though, men and women can connect directly with brands they like online. Not only does this mean more convenience, but it means guys can get beyond the few generic options they might find at a typical jewelry store.” (For more, see our guide to the <a rel=alternate href=#>best online jewelry stores.</a>)</p><p>You might also consider getting your jewelry outside of regular stores. “PLL (Previously Loved Luxury) is extremely popular now!” says Levinson. “Pawnbrokers are great places to purchase men's jewelry. You not only get like-new pieces of jewelry, but you can find them for a fraction of the retail price. Many can also order brand new pieces at a heavily discounted price from select wholesalers. When purchasing jewelry, it’s convenient to buy online, but it can be a good idea to purchase from a company that also has a brick and mortar location.”</p><p>A quick word of warning, wherever you decide to go: “There are a lot of great jewelers, but no matter where you go, make sure there is a good guarantee and warranty,” advises Singer. “Some metals, if not reputable, can incorporate alloys that can cause rashes and discoloration. If you find a jeweler you can trust, you'll be able to invest in a piece that can stand the test of time.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is trending in men's jewelry?</h3><p>While women’s jewelry seems to be constantly evolving with new trends, like <a rel=alternate href=#>permanent jewelry</a>, men’s jewelry has stayed a bit more traditional—until now. According to Schoenfeld, it’s all about, “Breaking rules and blurring lines. Men are taking more risks as jewelry is becoming increasingly gender-neutral, with slim designs being particularly popular, especially with necklaces.I assume this is a rejection of the big-faced watches and big chain periods. Also, I’m seeing guys wear more bracelets, watches, rings, and chains. Pearls continue to have a big moment on guys like never before.”</p><p>“Layering multiple pieces of jewelry, such as stacking bracelets or wearing layered necklaces, is a popular way for men to express their style,” says McGuire. “Mixing metals and textures adds depth to the look. Signet rings have also made a comeback in men's fashion–these rings often feature personalized engravings or family crests, adding a touch of sophistication and history. Customization and personalization remain a strong trend, with men choosing to engrave initials, dates, or meaningful symbols on their jewelry.”</p><h3>What size chain is best for a man?</h3><p>“The best size chain for a man depends on several factors, including personal style, neck size, and body type,” says McGuire. “First, consider your neck size: A longer chain may be more comfortable for someone with a larger neck, while a shorter chain might be better for someone with a smaller neck, so measure your neck circumference for a more precise fit. Body type can also influence the choice of necklace length–taller guys with broader shoulders may opt for longer chains, while shorter chains can work well for men with smaller frames.”</p><p>In terms of actual length, McGuire adds that, “For a casual and relaxed look, longer chains (22-24 inches) often work well. Shorter chains (18-20 inches) are typically more suitable for formal occasions or when wearing a pendant close to the neck.”</p><h3>Should guys wear gold or silver?</h3><p>“The answer depends on the man’s individual coloring and skin tone—one is not inherently more masculine than the other,” reasons McGuire. “Gold jewelry tends to complement warmer skin tones—men with darker complexions often find that gold jewelry complements their coloring beautifully. Men with fair or pale skin often find that silver jewelry enhances their complexion without overwhelming it.” (You can also follow this advice when looking for the <a rel=alternate href=#>best engagement ring </a>for your partner.)</p><p>Budget is also something to consider, of course. “When it comes to gold and silver, price is often the determining factor,” says Levinson. “An ounce of gold right now is over $1,800 per ounce. An ounce of silver is worth around $20, so silver is more affordable. Silver also requires more work, though, as it naturally tarnishes. So my vote is gold, as long as it fits within your budget.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnZq7tHnJnq6epKKueqO%2BwKebrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
