In a recent interview on The Jennifer Hudson Show, the queen shared her thoughts on paving the way for future queens.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shangela-is-paving-the-way-for-other-drag-queens>Shangela is Paving The Way for Other Drag Queens</h2><p>Dancing With the Stars has had tons of firsts, but nothing quite like this. This RuPaul’s Drag Race icon has truly served looks and moves throughout the competition. It’s no secret that she’s been a standout against celebrities like Wayne Brady, Charli D’Amelio, and more.</p><p>While discussing what it’s like to be the first queen, Shangela admitted that it’s not just about being the first. Instead, she hopes to pave the way for other queens.</p><p>“To be the first drag queen on Dancing With The Stars is not about just being the first,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “You got to walk through, and represent authentically and fiercely, and then you got to keep that door open for the girls comin’ behind you.”</p><p>She also admitted that she was a longtime fan of the series before joining this season. Although she has been a lifelong fan and has performed all over the world, she’s never been formally trained in dance. She also had never been in a ballroom setting. Even though she had no experience going into the competition, she strives to have fun while representing the drag community. She also wants to pave the way for other LGBTQ+ contestants on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drag Queens Make Massive Tips Due to Jennifer Hudson’s Discography</h2><p>In a brief moment, Shangela showcased how much she knows Hudson’s entire discography. The drag queen broke into song, singing the EGOT winner’s “Golden Slumbers.” Another song Shangela loves is “Where You At,” from the 2011 album I Remember Me.</p><p>After acknowledging her favorite tunes, the drag star thanked Hudson on behalf of all the drag queens everywhere saying that they earned tips lip-synching her songs.</p><p>“I got to thank you for every one dollar, five dollar, twenty dollar, and occasional 100 that every drag queen has made.” she said.</p><p>While discussing RuPaul’s Drag Race, the queen admitted that the series helped her gain a competitive edge and the confidence boost she needed. Now, she feels very comfortable competing on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>. Even though she is inexperienced in the ballroom, she’s trying her best to make it to the top of the leaderboard.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_HeidiKlum_LeniKlum_GothamFilmMagic.jpg alt="Heidi Klum, Leni Klum Strip Down for Sexy Lingerie Photoshoot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGYp5%2BVoa5uu8%2BepaxlpaV6oq7OrqtmmpWeu6h506GcZp6Zp8C1ecOrmKBloaqyprqMqKVmnKepwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
